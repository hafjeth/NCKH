ABSTRACT The textile and garment industry has made a remarkable contribution to the economic
development of Vietnam and employs currently a large labor force of 2.5 million
people. However, the textile industry is also seen as a most polluting and unsustainable
industry due to the use of excessive amounts of materials and the release of large
amounts of pollutants into the environment. In order to improve the environmental
sustainability and effectiveness of the textile industry in Vietnam this study has looked
into preventive measure, reuse/recycling options and improved end-of-pipe
technologies, separately and in combination. The end-of-pipe treatment is the last step in the greening production model. Textile
wastewater is very difficult to treat, especially regarding the high color intensity.
Removal of color from textile wastewater was studied by varying the pH, the
application of a biological treatment step, the application of coagulation/flocculation
and of Advanced Oxidation Processes (O3, O3/H2O2, Fenton’s reagent). The coagulation
process was very effective in color removal of insoluble dyestuffs (98%), but this
process is not so suitable for wastewater containing only soluble dyestuffs (12-55%). Of
the Advanced Oxidation Processes, the Fenton’s reagent process was the most effective
method for color removal (81-98%) for the four types of wastewater tested. The
decolorization with the ozone process at low pH (pH 5) showed that direct oxidation by
molecular ozone is much more selective in color removal than the oxidation by
hydroxyl radicals. The presence of colloidal particles caused a 12-fold increase for
ozone needed to obtain the same color removal efficiency as for a wastewater without
colloidal particles. Each of the investigated processes could only remove one or a few
types of pollutants from the wastewater, with the consequence that effluents could not
meet all the discharge regulations. The combination of an activated sludge process, and
a coagulation and ozone process yielded the best color (45 Pt-Co) and COD (30 mg
O2/L) removal at the lowest costs (0.3 €/m3), compared with all other tested
combinations. Separate collection of wastewater streams in a factory can also strongly contribute to the
efficiency and sustainability of wastewater treatment. In the wet processes of the textile
industry 75% of the total water consumption is for rinsing purposes. Wastewater from
most rinsing steps contains low amounts of pollutants and can be reused in other process
stages or can be discharged without treatment. An industrial ecology zone model, integrating preventive cleaner production
approaches, a waste exchange network for reuse and recycling, and new end-of-pipe
technologies, has been developed and assessed in two case studies: the Thanh Cong
Company and the Nhon Trach 2 Industrial Zone. The greening production model
developed for the Thanh Cong Company, a large-scale textile company in Hochiminh
city, included the combination of cleaner production, external waste exchange and end-
of-pipe technology. The dyestuffs, auxiliary chemicals, water and energy consumption
can be reduced significantly when the proposed cleaner production, the external waste
exchange options and the improved end-of-pipe technologies are implemented. Total
benefits in savings per day can be more than 1,000 US$. iv
The industrial ecology zone model was designed in three steps. Firstly the greening
production model developed for the Thanh Cong Company was applied to all textile
enterprises in the industrial ecology zone that was considered. Secondly an outside
waste exchange network was designed. The outside network includes reuse of waste
plastics, waste paper and waste oil at recycling companies in the neighborhood. The last
step is to treat solid waste and polluted air and to treat and reuse wastewater for
irrigation (cotton cultivation), for use in sanitary systems and to water plants in the
industrial zone. The case studies of the greening production model and of the industrial ecology zone
model demonstrated that a successful industrial ecology practice not only depends on
the interaction between enterprises inside but also on the interaction with the actor
networks outside the industrial system: the economic networks, the social networks and
the policy networks. These networks can contribute in different ways to the
implementation of the models. In the case study of a large textile company the
economic network is very important in the implementation of the greening production
model and in the case study of an industrial ecology zone the policy network play the
most important role in the implementation of the industrial ecology model. v

Total textile & garment export value 2000 - 2009
1.1 Vietnam’s textile & garment industry’s development Textile products are crucial for our life, especially in modern society. The textile and
garment sector plays an important role in satisfying people’s basic needs as well as
creating fashion and higher living standards. The demand for textile products has been
increasing in the world, following both population increase and economic prosperity. Over the last twenty years, Vietnam textile and garment industry has witnessed a strong
development. In the year 1986, textile production did not supply enough to fulfill the
domestic market demand and only few fabrics and clothing were exported. However
from 2007 to 2009, Vietnam ranked among the top ten of textile and garment exporting
countries and territories in the world. The Vietnam textile and garment industry has
contributed remarkably to the economic development of Vietnam. In year 2009 this
industry contributed 9% to Vietnam’s industrial value, 16.5% to the country’s export
turnover and created nearly 2.5 millions jobs. This industry continues to lead other
export industries in export turnover. Figure 1.1 indicates the textile and garment export
market in 2009 and the growth in total textile and garment export value from 2000 to
2009. These data show that the export value has continuously grown almost 20% in the
last seven years, with an especially large growth in 2007. In Vietnam, textile and
garment export value ranks first, even before oil and gas (An 2008; 2009). Figure 1.1: Textile & garment export market in 2009 and total textile and garment
export value from 2000 to 2009 Especially after Vietnam changed fundamentally from a central planned economy to a
market regulated one in 1986, textile and garment production changed dramatically. A
selection in the textile and garment industry took place. The number of state-owned
enterprises decreased due to lack of capital, old fashioned technologies and the end of
subsidies, while the number of private companies, limited liability companies and joint
stock companies increased over consecutive years. This marked a step forward, opening
a new development stage for the textile and garment industry. In 2009 the industry
comprised 2,500 companies of which 0,5% is state-owned, 1% is joint stock and limited
companies (state-owned capital >50%) joint stock, 76% is limited companies (state-
owned capital <50%) and private companies, 18.5% is FDI, and 4% is co-operations of
national and foreign companies (An 2009). 3
In order to meet market demand and improve its competitiveness, the Vietnam textile
and garment industry continuously invested and innovated equipment and technology.
Production capacity of the industry showed an increase of 51,200 to 75,000 tons fabric
over the period 1996-2000. In the 2005 the production capacity increased fivefold
compared to the production capacity of 2000. Despite the adverse impact of the recent
global economic crisis the production capacity in 2009 was the same as in 2008 with
187,000 tons of fibre, 480,000 tons of yarn, 1 million square meter of woven fabric,
200,000 tons of knitted fabric and 2.4 billion apparel products in 2009 (An 2007; 2008;
2009). The prestige and quality of Vietnamese textile and apparel products are highly
appreciated in the world market and the textile industry is seen as a very promising
producer and exporter in the future, creating a large number of jobs and contributing to
the elimination of hunger and the reduction of poverty. However, it is also seen as a
most polluting industry, due to large chemical consumption, a huge water demand, high
energy demand, as well as discharge of pollutants in great volumes of waste streams. 1.2 Environmental problems of the textile and garment industry 1.2.1 General manufacturing processes The manufacturing process of textile and garment includes several steps and complex
processes. In general, it consists of four main processes: yarn fabrication, fabric
production, dyeing & finishing, and sewing. A large textile enterprise usually operates
with four main processes: spinning, weaving, dyeing & finishing, and sewing, which
usually are located in the same factory. A medium enterprise usually operates two
processes: yarn fabrication or fabric production and dyeing & finishing. A small
enterprise usually operates only dyeing & finishing processes according to requirements
of the customer. The production processes and related waste generated are described in
Figure 1.2 to better understand these processes. It is one the most important starting
point to select suitable pollution abatement systems. 4 Figure 1.2: Main manufacturing processes and generated waste streams of a large
textile and garment enterprise Raw material Raw materials used in textile industry are: -
Natural fibers such as cotton, wool, etc. -
Synthetic fibers such as nylon, polyester, viscose, etc. -
Blended natural and synthetic materials. 5
Yarn fabrication process The yarn manufacturing process includes several steps such as opening/blending,
cleaning, carding/combing, drawing, roving and the spinning process. The aim of this
manufacturing process is to convert fibers into yarn or thread, which is used in the next
fabric production process. Fabric production process The fabric production includes three production methods: weaving, knitting, tufting and non- woven.  Weaving and knitting are most widely used in fabric manufacturing. Weaving
Weaving is most commonly used for producing fabric. The process uses two set of
threads, which interlace lengthwise (warp yarn) with widthwise ones (weft or filling
yarn).
To prevent warp yarn from breaking during weaving, the warp threads are coated before
weaving, to increase their strength and smoothness. Natural starches are the most
commonly used coating material, although compounds such as polyvinyl alcohol
(PVA), resins, alkali-soluble cellulosic derivatives and gelatin glue have been used.
Other chemicals such as lubricants, agents, and fillers are often added to impart
additional properties to a fabric. Remaining chemicals after sizing will become waste,
which contribute to a high COD load in the wastewater. Knitting
In the knitting process, fabric is formed through interlocking series of yarn loops. Rows
of stitches are formed so that each row hangs on the row behind it, usually using
sophisticated high speed machines. Dyeing process There are three main steps in the dyeing & finishing processes: preparing, dyeing, and
finishing. In some cases, the dyeing step is replaced by a printing step. Each process is
described more in detail below. Preparing step
Preparation or pre-treatment implies preparation of suitable weaved materials for
dyeing, printing, and finishing. In the preparation, impurities in raw materials have to be
removed. To guarantee good quality of the fabric materials, suitable for the down-
stream processes, several chemicals, auxiliaries and water are used in the pre-treatment
step. The five stages of pre-treatment include: Singeing(dyeing processing of woven cotton fabrics): removal of fibers protruding from
yarn or fabric in order to create a smooth finish (EPA 1997). Pollutants associated with
sizing include relatively small amounts of exhaust gases from the burners. Desizing: complete and uniform removal of all sizing materials from the fabric. This is
to optimize absorption in the subsequent dyeing and finishing steps. The sizing 6
materials are removed with hot water or enzymes, depending on the sizing material that
is used. The most commonly used sizing materials are starches or polyvinyl alcohol,
resins, alkali-soluble cellulosic derivatives and gelatin glue, lubricants, agents, and
fillers. So, remaining chemicals on fabrics will go into the wastewater. Desizing is one
of the largest pollution sources for the dyeing and finishing process and can contribute
up to 70% of the COD load in textile wastewater. Scouring: removal of impurities from raw material. In general, alkali chemicals,
together with surfactants, complexing, dispersing and reducing agents are used to
remove fat, wax, protein, detergents, lubricants, inorganic substances and residual sizes.
The alkali chemicals are used to saponify the fat on the fibers. The soap that is formed
then serves to emulsify the remaining waxes and to wash away any dirt or other
impurities. Waste that can be produced in the scouring process includes sodium
hydroxide, waxes, greases, surfactants, chelating agents, sodium silicate, fibrous matter,
processing oil, acid acetate and phosphate.  These are thus also present in the
composition of the wastewater.
Bleaching: whitening of fabric. Fabrics often require bleaching or whitening to prepare
them for dyeing or printing or to produce a clear white fabric. Bleaching agents are
chemical substances that oxidize colored compounds, thus removing color. Most
generated pollutants from bleaching processes entering the wastewater are hypochlorite
or chlorine, caustic soda, acids, hydrogen peroxide, and sodium silicate. Mercerizing: enhancement of subsequent dye application, luster and appearance of the
fabrics. In this process, the fabrics are immersed under tension in a highly concentrated
solution of an alkali substance for short controlled period, then they are washed off and
any excess alkali is neutralized. Caustic soda and sodium hydroxide are the main
pollutants in this process, so wastewater from this stage has a high pH.
Dyeing step The decoration of textiles can be achieved through varying the construction of fabric, by
adding color through dyeing, or by applying color by printing patterns. The color may
be added to fibers, yarns, constructed fabrics or finished products. The way of
application of the dyes generally relates to the characteristics of fibers. The ability of
fiber to accept each of the dyes, called substantiality or affinity, depends on several
factors. One of the factors is availability of appropriate chemically reactive groups in
both fibers and dyes; another factor is the chemical composition of the dye liquor.
Various dyes, auxiliaries, and basis chemicals which are used end in the wastewater
after the dyeing process. The dyeing processes can be split into two main methods: batch and continuous method.
The batch method is used to dye a large amount of yarn or fabric. The liquor and the
textile are placed together in a vessel, and the required amount of dyestuff is added in
accordance with the formulation/recipe. An intense interaction between the textile and
the liquor then occurs. The dyeing rate and hence the dyeing time can be controlled
within wide limits (about 1-2 hours). The (relative) dyeing rate increases with increase
of dyeing temperature, fiber swelling, and carrier concentration. With increasing
temperature, dye molecules can become more soluble (higher diffusion coefficient at
higher temperatures) and then they can more easily bond to the fabric, resulting in 7
decreased use of dyes, chemical concentration, and often a decreased fabric/water ratio.
Generally, most textile companies in Vietnam use batch methods.
In the continuous dyeing method, the dyestuff is first dissolved or dispersed in the
liquor. The dye liquor is locally applied in definite amounts to the textile, which
continuously passes through this liquor. The diffusion transfer of the dye into to the
textile is controlled by effective factors such as temperature and/or auxiliaries. The dye
solution is continuously supplied to the bath to replace the quantity removed by the
passing fabric. When the manufacturing process is changed from one color to another
color, the remaining dye solution in the bath, the rinsing of the bath together with the
associated pipes, produce a small volume of effluent with a high dye concentration.
Both the batch and the continuous dyeing method produce an effluent containing similar
chemical constituents, namely the exhausted dye and other auxiliary chemicals.
However, the concentration of exhausted dyes in the effluent streams from the two
methods can vary considerably. For the batch dye process up to 90% of the dyes and
auxiliary chemicals found in the final effluent stream comes from one-step of the
process (Buckley 1992). Theoretical calculations by Glover and Hill (1993) propose a
four-fold increase in dye concentration in the total effluent stream for a continuous
process over the equivalent batch process. Besides, the volume of the wastewater
generated from both methods also varies strongly. According to Glover and Hill (1993),
5 m3 per ton of goods for a continuous process compared with 120 m3 per ton for a batch
process. Not all these steps in dyeing processes are always necessary. The used steps can vary in
dependence of the difference in end products, application and site-specific
manufacturing practices, and type of fiber. Natural fibers typically require more
processing steps than manmade fibers. Processing methods may also differ according to
the final properties desired, such as tensile strength, flexibility, uniformity and luster
(EPA 1997). Printing process
Printing is the process in which a decorated surface with dye is pressed on the fabric.
Pigments are used for 75 to 85% of all printing operations. They do not require a
washing step and generate little wastewater. Generated pollutants from printing consist
of dyes, pigments, thickeners, and auxiliary chemicals. These will go into the
wastewater during the washing process, after the printing. Finishing process
The purpose of the finishing process is increased quality of textile: abrasion resistance
and tear strength of fabric. The process includes the use of chemicals and mechanical
treatment. Application of chemicals is done in conjunction with mechanical finishing
steps, which can involve brushing, ironing or other physical treatment used to increase
the luster and feel of textile(Encyclopedia of chemical technology 1978; EPA 1997;
Mattioli et al. 2002). There are hundreds of finishing chemicals, which include anion,
cation, non-ion and blended silicon softeners. This process results in the generation of
high concentrations of organic material in the wastewater, and small amounts of
wastewater. 8
Sewing process
The finished clothes are fabricated into a variety of apparel and household industrial
products.
1.2.2 Overview of environmental problems of the textile industry
From the general manufacturing process as described above, it can be concluded that
textile processing generates many waste streams, including liquid wastes, gaseous
wastes from the use of fuel, and solid wastes, some of which may be hazardous. The
composition of the waste streams will depend on the type of textile facility, the
processes and technologies being operated and the types of fibers and chemicals used. A
general characterization of main three waste streams is listed below. Wastewater
The textile industry is one of the most water polluting industries. Elements of concern
of the textile sector are that it consumes a large volume of water, energy, dyestuff,
auxiliary chemical agents and other chemicals. Wastewater arises at almost any step of
the textile production process, from preparation of the fiber up to finishing of fabric
process. In order to have a basis for a general evaluation of the volume and the concentration of
pollution of Vietnam’s textile industry, the measuring of flow rate, sampling and
analysis of wastewater, preparation of a questionnaire and data collection of different
types of textile enterprises and products has been carried out.
The consumption of water per product unit of different textile enterprises (in scale and
products) is indicated in Table 1.1. Water consumption varies widely between 10-415
L/kg product. In general, the consumption of water per product unit of knitting fabric is
the lowest (10-40 L/kg product). However among knitting fabric companies, some have
much higher water consumption levels (50-80 L/kg product). The companies with
cotton, synthetic and blended fabric products consume the highest amount of water,
varying between 64 and 250 L/kg product. The reason is that manufacturing processes
of cotton, synthetic and blended fabric products include several steps that require more
water. The data in Table 1.1 show that the water consumption of enterprises with low
production capacity is higher than companies with high capacity. The same is valid for
the enterprises with outdated machines and equipments, backward technologies, and
weak management. For example with the same cotton products, consumption of water
of the Hiep Thanh Company was only 38 L/kg product. The Song Tan Company
consumed 415 L/kg product. The Hiep Thanh has modern equipment and technology
with a capacity of 1,200 ton/year, while Song Tan operates with outdated machines and
equipment, backward technologies and a low capacity (60 ton/year). Table 1.1 also
shows that the volume of wastewater generated by the textile industry makes up more
than 90% of the water consumption of the enterprise. The volume of wastewater is
depended on the types of products, production processes, type of machines, scale of
enterprise and amounts between 10 and 9,700 m3/day. 9 Table 1.1: Volume of wastewater generated by 29 textile enterprises Name of Company

Source: Vietnam Textile and Garment Group; 28 Company-Agtex (2005)Viet (2003; 2006) 11 The composition of wastewater from 25 textile enterprises is shown in Table 1.2. The
wastewater has a COD concentration that shows a wide fluctuation from 245-11,150 mg
O2/L. A high value of COD often originates from the cotton fabric manufacturing
process (around 465-3,960 mg O2/L) and from the knitting fabric process (around 705-
11,150 mg O2/L). For synthetic fabrics, concentrations of COD were significantly
lower: 370-2140 mg O2/L. Meanwhile concentrations of COD generated from large
scale enterprises with equal products vary widely from 245-2,200 mg O2/L. Besides
COD, these wastewater streams contain dyestuffs (toxic organic chemicals), salts, and
surfactants. The ratio of BOD5/COD is found to be low: around 0.2-0.5. One of the
important characteristics of dye wastewater is the fact that it contains color agents. The
wastewater from small and medium-sized enterprises is often higher in color intensity
(495-3,680 Pt-Co) than the color of wastewater from large scale enterprises which
varies from 245-1,800 Pt-Co. Concentrations of heavy metals such as chromium, zinc,
and copper are very low. The pH of the wastewater varies widely from 3.9 to 11.3. The results in Table 1.2 indicate that the concentration of pollutants in the wastewater of
small enterprises is higher than in that of the medium-sized and large enterprises. The
explanation is that almost all small enterprises buy cheap chemicals from China and
Taiwan which are low in quality. Moreover, the amount of dyestuffs and chemicals used
in the manufacturing process is often based on management experiences. Wastewater
from small scale textile enterprises usually has high pollutant concentrations, which
contributes significantly to the amount of pollution to many canals and rivers. Medium-sized and large scale enterprises have more often invested in modern
equipment, good process control and buy good quality chemicals and dyestuffs.
Consequently, the concentration of chemicals and dyestuffs in wastewater streams are
lower. Table 1.2: Composition of textile and garment industry wastewater Name of  company Flow rate

Gaseous emissions have been identified as the second largest pollution problem (after
wastewater) for the textile industry. Air polluting sources come mainly from the
operation of boilers using fuel oil (FO) or diesel oil (DO). The boiler operation usually
generates sulphur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and hydrocarbons (HC). The air
quality inside enterprises is relatively clean, as can be seen from the results of
measurement presented in Table 1.3. The values of the analyzed parameters were lower
than the permissible threshold values of the environmental health standards.
The composition of air pollution from chimneys of some textile enterprises is tabulated
in Table 1.4. Inside the chimneys of boilers at the textile enterprises the concentration of
most analyzed inorganic parameters is lower than the air quality required by industrial
emission standards (TCVN 5939:2005). Only the concentration of sulphur dioxide
(SO2) is above standard for S.Y. Vina Ltd.Co. and for the 28 Company -Agtex. Table 1.3: Air quality inside 12 textile enterprises Name of enterprise Noise

Source: Viet (2003; 2006); Thanh Cong Company (2005);  28 Company- Agtex (2006) Other significant sources of air emission in textile industry are related to resin finishing,
printing, dyeing and fabric preparation. For instance, hydrocarbons (HC) are emitted
from drying ovens and mineral oils in high temperature drying/curing. Acetate and
formaldehyde are two major emissions of concern in the textile industry. According to
VINATEX (2003) concentrations of these organic substances were low in
manufacturing zones for most textile enterprises; for instance acetate was in the range of
0.03-4.30 mg/m3, and hydrocarbons concentration was 0.01-4.71 mg/m3. In addition, particulate pollution (dust) is also one of the issues of concern for textile
and garment production. The particulates originate mainly from yarn, weaving and
sewing processes. In according with statistics of VINATEX (2003)  for loose raw
material, particulate in yarning and weaving process are 1.5-2% and 0.5-1%.
Particulates generated from yarning, weaving and sewing processes are as follows
(VINATEX 2003): -
Yarning process
: 1.10-3.44 mg particulates/m3
-
Weaving process
: 1.16-1.50 mg particulates/m3
-
Sewing process
:  0.93-1.15 mg particulates/m3 16 Solid waste Solid wastes generated from the textile industry are primarily non-hazardous. It includes
scraps of yarn and fabric, miss produced yarn and fabric, and packaging waste. All non-
hazardous waste is separated at source and recycled in other enterprises. In accordance
with decision No. 23/2006/QD of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment
which lists hazardous waste, sludge generated by wastewater treatment systems of
textile industry, chemical storage drums, and outdated chemicals and dyestuffs should
be considered hazardous substances. Almost all hazardous waste, especially sludge, is
not treated by professional companies. Total amounts of solid waste generated daily
from textile enterprises, and the composition of sludge, are summarized in Tables 1.5
and 1.6. Table 1.5: Amount of solid waste generated daily from 4 textile enterprises Hazardous waste

employees the sector employs up to 24% of the industrial workforce, of which 80% is
female. One company has even over 5,000 workers. So, textile and garment enterprises
are usually built in or close to residential areas. This adds domestic environmental
pressures and hindrances to the industrial ones through large volumes of discharged
domestic wastewater, domestic solid waste, and traffic jams from a large amount of
commuters. 1.2.3 Conclusions Of the three main waste streams from the textile industry, wastewater is the most
problematic and polluting one. As it is often discharged directly, it affects directly
surface water quality of local canals and rivers through its high concentration of
pollutants and large flow rate. Sulphur oxides, and especially SO2, have been identified
as the second largest pollution problem, mainly originating from the operation of
boilers. Industrial solid waste source has hardly and impact on the environment, with
the exception of wastewater treatment sludge. Domestic wastes impact depends on the
amounts.
1.3 Current environmental protection and management in the textile industry 1.3.1 The administrative environmental management system in Vietnam
The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) is the top state
management agency for national natural resource management and environmental
protection. The National Assembly established MONRE in 2002. The tasks of MONRE
cover seven main fields in connection with land, water resources, geology and minerals,
environment, hydrometeorology, geo-information survey and mapping, and marine
protection. The Vietnam Environment Protection Agency (VEPA) is one of the four
agencies of MONRE. This agency assists MONRE in executing state management tasks
regarding environmental protection. The major tasks and responsibilities of VEPA
include areas such as: examination, supervision, prevention, mitigation and remediation
of environmental pollution, degradation and incidents; improvement of environmental
quality; conservation of biodiversity; environmental monitoring; application of clean
technology; developing database statistics, information and reporting on environment;
implementing integrated coastal zone management; and education to enhance the
awareness of the community on environment. September 30th, 2008 the VEPA changed
its name in to Vietnam Environment Administration (VEA) based on Decision No.
132/2008/QD-TTg of the Prime Minister. The establishment of VEA was an important
step in the process of the planning agencies for environmental management of the State
and marked the growth and development of the environmental sector of the country. The Departments of Natural Resource and Environment (DONREs) are the state
management agencies for natural resource management and environmental protection at
provincial/city level. DONREs fall under the responsibility of city/provincial
governments, called people’s committees (PCs), and professionally under MONRE. 18 There are 64 provincial DONREs in Vietnam. DONREs activities consist of appraisal of
environmental impact assessments; examination, supervision, inspection, remediation of
environmental pollution, degradation and incidents; improvement of environmental
quality; environmental monitoring; education to enhance the awareness of the
community on environment. They also assist PCs on the master plans. In all large cities/provinces with industrial development an Industrial Zones Authority
(IZA) was established to carry out environmental management for industrial and export
processing zones. The IZAs are established by PCs and have responsibility to examine
and supervise enterprises in industrial zones for compliance with environmental
protection; to resolve environmental disputes and problems caused by environmental
accidents in the industrial zones, together with DONREs; to handle complaints of
enterprises; and education and raising awareness of the employees. Environmental Protection Divisions (EPD) at the district and community levels is the
lowest state management agencies for natural resource management and environmental
protection. The EPD belong to people’s committees at district level. Following the Law
on Environmental Protection (2005) EPD’s responsibility and power are enhanced to
effectively protect the environment. Tasks of the EPD include appraisal of
environmental protection commitments; supervision and examination to comply with
the regulation on environmental protection; resolving public complaints and
environmental disputes. The environmental management structure in Vietnam is
presented in Figure 1.3. When an enterprise is established, it has to carry out regulations
of environmental protection, as summarized in Figure 1.4. 19 Figure 1.3: Environmental management structure in Vietnam Direct management

Enterprises 21 1.3.2 Environmental protection policy At the Earth summit on Environment and Development held in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro
(Brazil) the Government of Vietnam passed the Declaration on Environment and
Development and Agenda 21. Since then, Vietnam has further transformed its socio-
economic development model and its system of environmental protection. Many
important policies on management and utilization of natural resources and
environmental protection have been developed and implemented. A system of law and
national standards was enacted, meeting practical requests and needs for renovation in
the country, such as a new labor code, a law on public health care and protection, a law
on environmental protection, etc. Remarkable events in environmental protection in
Vietnam from 1991-2009 are listed in Table 1.7.

regulation on industrial wastewater discharges  (QCVN 24:2009) Although Vietnam has a well-developed system of policies and legal instruments, the
system can not keep pace with the rapid development of industry, business, services,
and population. Consequently, the natural environment has been seriously compromised
in many areas and environmental pollution and deterioration has reached alarming
levels. The making of Vietnam‘s environmental protection policy started later than in
many other countries, and is still in its infancy and with incomplete implementation and
enforcement. Hence, there is no balanced combination of three dimensions of
development: economic, social and environmental protection. The problem reveals
through the document of control and inspection of 285 enterprises in 2006 of the
Vietnam Environmental Protection Agency (VEPA). According to this document, only
19% of the enterprises build wastewater treatment plants, and only 4% of the companies
had wastewater treatment plants meeting the Vietnamese standards; only 16% of the
enterprises had an air pollution treatment system, and 21% of the enterprises carried out
monitoring of environmental quality; 5% of the enterprises had not yet made an
Environment Impact Assessment report (VEPA 2007).
The explanation is that in Vietnam policies have been in favor of economic
development and social stability, but have yet to pay full attention to sustainability in
exploitation and utilization of natural resources. Too much emphasis on economic
development, especially GDP growth, resulted in a severely deteriorated environment. 24 1.3.3 Relocation programmed
Most paper factories, food processing companies, textile enterprises and many other
industries were established in Vietnam without planning, especially in big cities such as
Hochiminh city, Ha Noi, and Bien Hoa. In Hochiminh city about 35,000 medium small
enterprises are scattered throughout the city, often located in densely populated urban
areas without any waste treatment system. To minimize environmental pollution from
industrial activities and improving the living conditions of residents, Hochiminh city
authorities developed in 2002 a policy of relocating polluting small enterprises to
industrial zones outside Hochiminh city. The “Integration of relocation of polluted
enterprises to Industrial Zones (IZ)” program was originally planned to run between
2002 and 2004. Until now, Hochiminh city has been the only city with a relocation
program. The main objectives of the relocation program in Hochiminh city included:
-
To remove the seriously polluting enterprises into industrial zones or suburbs, where
firms can use common wastewater treatment facilities; -
To rearrange existing production activities, and reorganize the licensing for new
investment projects which consider the abatement of pollution in industry;
-
To concentrate small scale enterprises of the same branch into clusters, in order to
create large scale conglomerates. By doing so these small scale enterprises can share
costs and develop an efficient organizational structure for environmental protection
and better market competition;
-
To further develop industrial zones in Hochiminh city. According to a report of the Department of Natural Resources and Environment
(DONRE) in 2006, this program was prolonged to 2006. Financial support was too
small during the first years, there were problems with finding enough land for the
relocation program (720ha), and infrastructure in the relocation zones was often not
available. Up to the end of 2006, when the program finished, there were 1,402 highly
polluting enterprises in the list of the relocation program, of which 1261 (90% of the
1,402 enterprises) achieved results:
-
Relocation: 630 enterprises, (50% of the 1261 companies)
-
Stopping the production: 463 enterprises (36.8%)
-
Change of products produced: 127 enterprises (10%)
-
Onsite application of remediation: 36 enterprises (2.8%)
-
Requests for expanding the relocation time: 5 enterprises (0.4%) Through this program, small and medium-sized textile enterprises moved to industrial
zones or suburbs or stopped production. Large state-owned enterprises could not
relocate to the industrial zones because these enterprises require quite some land, water
and energy, which these industrial zones could not deliver. Therefore, they carried out
onsite remediation, by investing in waste treatment systems. However, these enterprises
still seriously pollute the environment in populated areas. One of the future strategies
for the Vietnam’s textile and garment industry is to invest in building a textile and
garment industrial zone, with complete infrastructure including a water supply system,
electricity, and centralized wastewater treatment plant. This would also improve their
competitiveness in the world. 25 1.3.4 Current status of waste treatment in the textile industry
Wastewater treatment A survey on the present situation of textile wastewater treatment technology was carried
out for different sizes of enterprises. The results show that almost no wastewater
treatment facility meets the industrial wastewater-discharge standards (TCVN: 5945-
2005, class B) for both COD and color intensity. The reason is that textile wastewater
changes strongly within a day, even per hour, making it very difficult to treat.
Enterprises do not have the professional manpower to fine-tune the wastewater
treatment operations. Beside, Vietnamese standards for color and COD are very strict.
To meet color and COD standards (50 Pt-Co and COD 80 mg O2/L) requires modern
technology. Moreover, costs of wastewater treatment operation are high and increase
production costs. Therefore, direct discharge of wastewater into sewers, canals or rivers
occurs regularly. Lastly, the design of treatment systems does not meet the requirements
because consulting companies hardly ever investigate properly the composition and
volume of wastewater. Textile wastewater treatment technology can be divided into: (1) physical/chemical
treatment (coagulation), (2) a combination of physical/chemical treatment (coagulation)
and biological treatment (aerobic treatment). The selection of technology will depend on
the discharge standards to be achieved. Enterprises located inside an industrial zone only have to meet the TCVN 5945: 2005
(industrial wastewater-discharge standards), class C (water quality standards for
industrial effluents discharged into sewer systems). The standard is described in Table
1.8.  The current wastewater treatment technology applied in most enterprises is
presented in Figure 1.5. Figure 1.5: Standard wastewater treatment system for textile industry The application of a coagulation process can only reduce suspended solids and colloidal
particles resulting in a decrease in color of nearly 50%. Table 1.8 lists suspended solids
of effluents of Nhan Thanh, Tan Tien Cuong, and Duc Hoa Co., Ltd. A site survey
shows that the suspended solids in the effluent are still high, due to the short
sedimentation period, which cannot ensure the total settlement of solids. The data in
Table 1.8 also show that almost all effluents do not meet the discharge standards for
COD, because the coagulation process does not sufficiently reduce the dissolved
organic compounds. Sulfate concentration of effluents from some wastewater treatment
systems was higher than influent, because alum sulfate was used as the coagulant.
Among seven enterprises tested, only Hong Tien Phat Co., Ltd met the discharge
standards due to a low influent concentration. Settling/filter

not yet provided with a centralized wastewater treatment plant), need to meet discharge
standards TCVN 5945:2005, class B: water quality standards for industrial effluents
discharged into surface water resources which are not used for potable water production.
The present situation regarding the wastewater treatment technology of Thanh Cong
Company is described in Figure 1.6. Figure 1.6: Advanced treatment wastewater treatment system combining
physical/chemical treatment (coagulation) and biological treatment of Thanh Cong
Company However, with this treatment system the color intensity of the effluent does not meet the
discharge standards (50 Pt-Co). It is very difficult to meet these standards with the
present treatment technology. The data in Table 1.9 illustrate that with the applied
treatment technology, COD can not decrease to below the allowable threshold (COD:
100 mg O2/L). Namtex Company and Houlon Corporation Vietnam are also equipped with a
wastewater treatment system similar to the one mentioned in Figure 1.6. However, these
are provided with an aerobic process before the coagulation process (Figure 1.7).
However, after treatment the color and COD of the effluent still exceed the standard. Composition of effluent from combined of physical/chemical and biological treatment
systems or biological and physical/chemical treatment (following Figures 1.6 and 1.7) is
presented in Table 1.9. Figure 1.7: Advanced treatment wastewater treatment system combining
biological treatment and physical/chemical treatment (coagulation) of Namtex

in Table 1.10, show that the effluent exceeds the discharged standards many times on
color and COD, and thus post treatment may not improve treatment efficiency. The
results show that the system is not operated properly. Figure 1.8: Wastewater treatment system of  S.Y. Vina Co., Ltd (inside an

Source:Viet(2006) 31 Air pollution treatment Almost all textile enterprises in and outside industrial zones are not equipped with an air
wastes treatment system. Waste gasses are emitted directly (sometimes via a chimney)
into the environment. Most chimneys have only height of 5-20 m. Few enterprises are
equipped with treatment systems for exhaust gas from boilers. Such treatment systems
consist of wet absorption with an alkali solution as absorbent (Figure 1.9). Particulate
pollution is abated with a cyclone or filter bag. Figure 1.9: Air pollution treatment technology of textile enterprises Solid waste treatment Industrial production premises do classify domestic solid wastes and industrial solid
wastes. The implemented treatment directions of solid wastes nowadays are: -
Domestic solid waste is collected and treated (on contractual basis) by the
Provincial/District Urban Environment Company.
-
Industrial solid wastes, including non-hazardous and hazardous waste, which is not
yet classified, is sold to companies buying scraps. Part of the industrial wastes is
sold to recycling companies, while the rest of the industrial wastes are disposed
together with domestic solid wastes. -

few enterprises contract a professional company for treatment of sludge.
1.3.5 Cleaner Production The Government of Vietnam passed the International Declaration on Cleaner
Production in 1999 and the National Cleaner Production Action Plan (2001-2005) was
born in 2003. After seven years implementing cleaner production (CP), 200 enterprises
of different industries and scale had joined the cleaner production demonstration
projects. According to the Vietnam Environment Protection Agency- VEPA (2006) the
number of textile enterprises that implemented CP was 34 (out of a total of 2,000 textile
and garment enterprises). Figure 1.10 shows the limited number of enterprises that had
implemented CP, compared to the total number of enterprises in Vietnam.
Implementation of CP in Vietnam happens through demonstration projects, which is
financed by international organizations or the government. At the end of demonstration
projects all activities related to CP in these enterprises come to a stop. Exhaust gas

1.3.6 Application of ISO 14001 in textile industry and environmental protection
performance of the textile industry
In recent years, textile and garment enterprises have replaced most obsolete equipment,
and invested in purchasing modern equipment to produce high quality products for
export. The EU, Japan, Canada and the US request textile products of high quality, and
also an environmentally sound working environment. In order to exports textile
products to these countries exporting enterprises have to treat waste (wastewater, air
pollution, solid waste) and have to develop and certify an ISO14000 environmental
management system. Through ISO 14000 certification, exporting textile and garment
enterprises will improve market opportunities as well as environmental performance.
Achieving ISO 14001 certification is now believed to be one of the key tasks of the
textile and garment industry (VINATEX 2003). In Vietnam the number of enterprises
with ISO certification has increased in recent years (Figure 1.11), and that is also true
for the Vietnamese textile enterprises. It shows the benefits of ISO once companies have
understood they have to invest to get a higher return. Figure 1.11: ISO 14001 certification application in Vietnam, 1998-2007

1.4. Development strategies of textile and garment industry for 2015 to 2020 According to development strategies for the textile and garment industry for 2015 to
2020 (Dung 2008) targets of the textile and garment industry include: -
Developing the textile and garment industry to become one of the key export
industries, satisfying the domestic consumption demand, creating employment,
improving the competition ability, integrating stability in the region and in the
world. -
The production growth rate should reach 12-14% and export growth should
become 15% per year. 34 -
Export turnover should reach 18 billion US$ in 2015 and 25 billion US$ in 2020
together with employment of about 2.75 million people in 2015 and 3 million
people in 2020. In correspondence with the above targets, this strategy means for the textile and garment
industry the following: -
Development of the textile and garment industry in the direction of specialization
and modernization, in order to create a leap in quality and quantity of products
and move towards conditions that are stable, sustainable and effective. -
Overcoming the weaknesses of industry such as underdevelopment, inadequate
and untimely supply of accessories, not paying proper attention to fashion design
and trademark development. -
Taking exports as the target for the development, enlarge export markets,
develop and maximize the domestic market. Concentrating on development of
supporting industry, improving added value for products.
-
Diversifying the ownership and enterprise types in the textile and garment
industry, mobilizing all local and overseas resources to invest and develop textile
and garment production.
-
Developing the human resources in terms of quality and quantity, properly
training managers, technicians, designers and skillful workers. Environmental protection is recognized as an inseparable part in the development of the
textile and garment industry to achieve sustainable development. The development
strategy of textile and garment industry until 2015 towards 2020 with regard to the
execution of the environmental protection programs is concentrated into issues below. -
Development of the textile and garment industry in association with protecting
environment and transferring companies to labor rich (rural) environments;
-
Moving the polluting enterprises (dyeing and weaving enterprises) out of the
cities to Industrial Zones with complete infrastructure such as a water supply
system, electricity and centralized wastewater treatment. -
Moving the garment enterprises to provinces with abundant workforce sources
and favorable transportation.
-
Encouraging implementation of Cleaner Production and environmental
management system (ISO 14001), especially for large scale enterprises and
enterprises exporting to the EU, Japan, US market, in order to improve the
quality of their products, services and to have competitive production. In the targets of the development strategy for the textile and garment industry from 2015
to 2020, there are many advantages to apply “Greening textile and garment industry in
Vietnam”, especially in the approach of an industrial ecology zone. 35 1.5 The objective and structure of the thesis 1.5.1 The objective The textile industry is an industry in rapid development in Vietnam. Vietnam’s textile
and garment industry has made a remarkable contribution to economic development,
with more than 2 millions employees. However, its development has relied on low labor
productivity; energy intensive production technology; high natural resource
consumption; and release of large amounts of emissions. Although enterprises have
built waste treatment facilities, actually almost all these facilities are operating
inefficiently, resulting in serious environmental deterioration and human health
problems. In Vietnam the textile industry is seen as one of the most polluting industries. Many programs have been carried out to minimize pollution in the textile and garment
industry and to move to more sustainability. However, these programs have almost
always concentrated on one approach or technology or waste stream. The objective of this thesis is to focus on the development and desk application of an
integrated model combining pollution minimization and end-of-pipe technologies for
individual enterprises as well as for combined enterprises in a (textile) industrial
ecological zone. In order to achieve a sustainable development of the textile industry
subsequent steps have to be analyzed; first, to maximize resource efficiency: second, to
minimize and recycle waste; and finally, to treat remaining waste streams, especially
wastewater. Such an integrated approach has to look not just into technological options (whether
they be resource efficiency, waste exchange or treatment systems) but also into the role
private and public actors (can) play in the implementation of such technological options. 1.5.2 The structure of the thesis The structure of thesis includes eight chapters as following: Chapter 1: General introduction on Vietnam textile & garment industry
In this chapter the Vietnamese textile & garment industry development and strategies,
together with environmental problems and current status of the industry’s environmental
protection performance are introduced. Also the goals of the research are described. Chapter 2: Environmental protection in textile industry: concepts and methods

experimental research The chapter deals with the experimental data and assessment on the application of a
combination of physical/chemical and biological treatment processes to completely
remove color and COD of the textile wastewater. The results are compared regarding
treatment efficiency and economical costs in order to choose the best treatment method
to comply with strict discharge standards. Chapter 5: Separation of wastewater streams: experimental research The chapter gives the survey data and assessment on reuse ability of separated
wastewater streams. The treatment technologies of each wastewater stream are

Textile and Garment Joint Stock Company This chapter describes application of an integrated approach combining pollution
minimization and end-of-pipe treatment for a large state owned textile enterprise,
evaluating achieved efficiencies. Chapter 7: Case study of Industrial Ecology at “Nhon Trach 2 Industrial Zone” This chapter deals with the modeling of efficient use of resources in and outside an
existing textile industrial zone in order to close material cycles and to (re)use resources
and waste as efficiently as possible. Chapter 8: Conclusions and recommendations Chapter 2 Environmental protection in the textile industry: concepts and m ethods 38 2.1 Introduction Most industrial production processes generate waste, and so does the textile industry.
The quantity and composition of waste depends on many factors such as industrial
production scale, raw materials used, production management, technologies, the kind of
products produced, and the capacity of treatment, reuse and recovery. Hence, within the
textile production sector, different production plants will show different pollution
profiles, so that the idea of “one solution fits all” will not work. This chapter deals with environmental protection approaches for the textile industry in
the world as well as Vietnam. Different circumstances require different (combinations
of) approaches to effectively protect the environment. In introducing the various
approaches, technologies and methods of environmental protection in this chapter, a
distinction will be made in three main categories, dealt with in three subsequent
sections. Section 2.2 introduces a variety of so-called end-of-pipe solutions and
approaches; all focused on treating waste streams from textile production plants. Section
2.3 elaborates on cleaner production approaches and methodologies. Section 2.4 focuses
on the more recent notion of industrial ecology, which looks at environmental
protection beyond separate production units. Section 2.5 moves beyond technology and
introduces the actors and institutions involved in implementing such environmental
protection approaches. The final section elaborates on the methodology of the thesis.
2.2 End-of-pipe technology To comply with regulation of national environmental agencies industries are forced to
treat their waste (including the wastewater) before discharging it. End-of-pipe
technology is applied to treat pollution from industrial activities, and ranges from
simple to complex and advanced technologies. Many types of technological processes-
alone or in combination - have been applied to remove pollutants from waste streams in
various
industries:
physical
(settling,
filtering),
physical/chemical
(coagulation/flocculation), absorption, chemical (oxidation, neutralization), and
biological (anaerobic, aerobic) processes. End-of-pipe technology was the first approach to be widely used in industrial
production processes for environmental pollution control, from the 1950s onwards first
in the more developed parts of the world. But the building, operation and maintenance
of these waste treatment systems add to production costs and thus affect the
competitiveness of industries. Besides, such waste treatment processes form by-
products. For instance, waste sludge is generated from wastewater treatment systems
that treat wastewater wit heavy metals by coagulation or precipitation processes. Thus,
end-of-pipe waste treatment measures are often only transferring contaminants from one
medium to another medium. For example, domestic solid waste is dumped in landfills
which will generate biogas and soil pollution. Hence, also within end-of-pipe treatment technologies there is recently more attention to
reuse and recycling waste: to improve the environmental performance, to reduce the
financial burden of waste treatment, and to exploit resources. Innovative technologies 39 have been applied to achieve better treatment efficiency and to solve some of the end-
of-pipe technology’s shortcomings. Hence, end-of-pipe technology is increasingly
becoming a suitable solution for environmental protection. As mentioned in chapter 1,
the textile industry is seen as one of the most polluting industries, textile wastewater
treatment has been extensively researched in laboratories, via pilot cases, and in
practice. The various treatment processes studied can be divided into biological,
physical/chemical, chemical, and other processes. Many of these processes are only
functioning on a laboratory or pilot scale, including electrochemical and pair (double)
extraction (which are not yet suitable to be applied for high organic concentrations and
large volumes as textile wastewater).  Until now, only a few technologies have been
applied for wastewater from full scale textile industries. In this chapter, many treatment
processes will be reviewed in depth, in term of cost, feasibility, practicability, stability,
environmental impact. The reviewed technologies are: -
Change of color by pH adjustment
-
Coagulation processes
-
Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs)
-
Membrane processes
-
Biological process with anaerobic and aerobic processes
-
Combination of different processes
2.2.1 Change of color by pH adjustment
Due to dyestuffs complex chemical structures, they are resistant to fading on exposure
to light, water and many chemicals (Poots et al. 1976a; McKay 1979). According to
Phyllips (1996), almost all dyestuffs contain one or more benzene rings or more
complex aromatic compounds. The name aromatic compounds is derived from the fact
that the rings are often a part of a substance with strong covalent bonds, and usually
have a pleasant odor. In the chemical structure of dyestuffs, the groups that cause the
color are called chromophore groups. The groups that increase the color intensity of the
chromophore are called auxochrome groups. The modern viewpoint is that the
chromophore group is a conjugated system of double bonds (Van der Zee et al. 2001;
Van der Zee 2002). If light absorption of the chromophore is very small the substance
would not be a dyestuff. Dyestuffs usually contain auxochrome groups which are acid
or base groups, ionized and strongly polar. These auxochrome groups are fixed at two
sides in the dyestuff molecule to form an electron fuse or attraction force within the
dyestuff. Therefore, the color of dyestuffs can be affected by the pH. In fact,
decolorization of a solution can occur within a narrow pH range. Some compounds
undergo a color change or even become colorless in certain pH ranges. One of examples
is the p-nitrogen phenolate ion, which is yellow in an acid solution and turns blue-
yellow in an alkaline solution. The pH is a prominent factor in wastewater treatment processes like the coagulation
process as well as in the chemical oxidation. Chemical oxidation processes are effective
only within a certain pH range. The Fenton’s reagent process, for example, has its
optimal pH around 3-5, and the ozonation process efficiency is also pH dependent. The
same is true for coagulation. To better understand the effect of only pH, and the pH in
the physical/chemical and oxidation processes on color change, an experiment on the
effect of pH on color intensity is described in chapter 3. 40 2.2.2 Coagulation/flocculation process
Coagulation/flocculation process are often applied to remove colloidal, suspended solids
which are not directly removed by sedimentation, filtration, and flotation processes. The
coagulation process involves the chemical destabilization of colloidal particles and the
formation of larger particles through agglomeration of destabilized colloids into
microflocs, progressing into bulky flocs that can settle. The colloidal particle destabilization can be obtained by addition of a reasonable dosage
of potential determining ions, electrolytes, hydrolyzed metal ions. These chemicals are
called coagulants. Adding potential determining ions or electrolytes is in general not
feasible in wastewater treatment because it needs a large amount to achieve a reduced
zeta potential or change of the charge double layer. Hydrolyzed metal ions, however,
provide good results in terms of treatment efficiencies and costs. According to Metcalf and Eddy (2003), particle destabilization and removal by
hydrolyzed metal ions, such as alum and iron, is a complex process. Process factors
which can promote the coagulation/flocculation process are velocity gradient, reactive
time, and pH (Lenntech 2004). The pH is a prominent factor in a coagulation process,
the time and velocity gradient are related to the probability of the particles meeting each
other. The dosage of coagulant/flocculant needed depends on the nature of the particles,
and the pH and temperature of the wastewater. Factors such as pH, dosage of coagulant,
temperature are often used in studies for coagulation process. Typical coagulants and flocculants are aluminum sulfate, aluminum chloride, ferric
chloride, ferric sulfate, ferrous sulfate, calcium hydroxide, sodium aluminum and pre-
hydrolyzed metal salts such as poly-aluminum chloride and poly-iron chloride.
Aluminum sulfate, ferric sulfate, ferrous chloride and poly-aluminum chloride are
commonly used in coagulation process because they are commonly available, cheap,
have high color removal efficiency. There is an abundance of literature on the coagulation process as a textile wastewater
treatment. The coagulation is found to be effective in the color removal of insoluble
dyestuffs such as disperse, azoic, vat and sulphur dyes, but not or less not effective for
the removal of soluble dyes (Olcay et al. 1996; Vandevivere et al. 1998; Oliver et al.
2000; Kao et al. 2001). In contrast, there are some studies that show that the coagulation
process is efficient in the color removal of soluble dyes, such as reactive and acid dye
(Stahr et al. 1980; Thakur et al. 1994), and unsatisfactory in the color removal of
insoluble dyestuffs such as vat dyes (Mattioli et al. 2002). Literature research reveals that in some cases the color removal in raw wastewater may
be more efficient applying the coagulation process with aluminum sulfate. A good
removal efficiency of 42% for COD was obtained with a combination of aluminum salt
and lime (Altinbas et al. 1995). In general, the removal of heavy metals can also take
place in a coagulation process (Abdel-Shafy et al. 1996; Mollah et al. 2001; Amuda et
al. 2006). However, removal of recalcitrant organic matter, nutrients and salts is limited
for the coagulation process (Vandevivere et al. 1998; Lefebvre and Moletta 2006). 41 Results of Stahr et al. (1980) show that an alum salt dosage in the range of 100 to 500
mg/l efficiently removes color for sulphur dyes, vat and acid dyes. Panswad and
Wongchaisuwan (1986) discovered that magnesium carbonate combined with lime can
remove over 90% of the color from a reactive dye wastewater. The same was found by Mehrotra et al. (1995) for sulphur dye, they reported a color removal of 90% using
MgCO3 at pH of 10. Thakur (1994) reported that the coagulation process can remove color up to 90% from
reactive dye wastewater with 50 ppm Fe3+ or Al3+ under acid condition. However,
Marmagn  and Coste (1996) found low removal efficiencies with the coagulation
process of certain types of dyes such as reactive and acid dyes with the same coagulants. Olcay et al. (1996) carried out coagulation studies for removing color from an acid
dyeing bath. The achieved efficiencies were low with dosages of 1,000 mg aluminum,
ferrous, and ferric salts per liter wastewater. Aluminum salt gave the highest removal
efficiency of 55%, at a pH of 7.5, with ferrous salt this was 39% at a pH 9 and with
ferric salt 12% at a pH 7.5. For wastewater which was collected from balance tank,
containing reactive dyes (initial color 230 Pt-Co), 250 mg aluminum salt/L at pH 7.8
and 250 mg ferrous salt/L at pH 10.5 gave a high efficiency in terms of color and COD
removal, the color removal efficiency was 91% (remaining color 20 Pt-Co) for ferrous
coagulant and 83% for aluminum. According to Tuba (2001) the coagulation process with aluminum and ferric salts for
color and COD removal of wastewater from a cotton fabric manufacturing process
(disperse and reactive dye) gave a color and COD removal efficiency of 45% and 68%
for aluminum, and 43 % and 69% for ferric salts with the same dosage of 1,250 mg/L at
pH 6. In a synthetic fabric manufacturing process using 4 types of dye: disperse,
reactive, sulphur and termosol, aluminum salt with a dosage of 200 mg/L at pH 5
achieved a removal efficiency of 67% for color and 48% for COD. According to Perkowski et al. (2000) a dosage of 100 mg Fe2+ at pH 8 removed 85% of
the color and 35% of the COD per liter raw textile wastewater. Kao et al. (2001)
indicated that most textile wastewater treatment systems, with a combination of a
biological treatment and chemical coagulation in Taiwan could not produce an effluent
that met the color standards (400 ADMI); the color removal efficiency of the
coagulation step ranged from 40-70%. According to Azbar et al. (2004), coagulation with 350 mg FeSO4/L at pH 8.5 can only
remove 50% of the color and 40% of the COD for wastewater generated from an acetate
and polyester fiber manufacturing process.
Summarizing some of the findings of the literature on the coagulation process it is clear
that the pH plays a prominent role in the removal efficiency of the coagulation process.
The optimal pH for aluminum salt in the range of 5 to 7.8, for ferrous salt this is from 8-
10. These pH values are suited for coagulation with aluminum and ferrous salt. The
dosage of coagulant is varied depending on nature and concentration of dyestuffs. The
aluminum sulfate dosage ranged from 100 to 1,250 mg/L to obtain color removal
efficiencies of 43 to 91%, for ferrous sulfate this was 200 to 1,000 mg/L, achieving 42 lower removal efficiencies than aluminum sulfate. A good removal efficiency of 35-
91% for COD was obtained with the coagulation process. One of the main drawbacks of coagulation process is the generation of large amounts of
sludge (Mattioli 2002). In addition, the coagulation process adds a large amount of
coagulant and pH adjustments solution into the wastewater, consequently this will
increase the salt concentration (or electric conductivity) of the effluent. Reuse of water
and dye and chemical recovery are still not applicable using the coagulation process as
wastewater treatment. However, the coagulation process is used widely in textile
wastewater treatment plants at present. In short, the coagulation process may efficiently remove color and COD from textile
wastewater at optimal conditions established in laboratory or pilot studies. The effect of
pH, dosage and type of coagulant on the removal efficiencies for several types of textile
wastewaters was investigated. The results are presented in chapter 3.
2.2.3 Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs)
Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are mostly based on the action of highly reactive
radical species (especially the hydroxyl radical OH) that can react with a wide range of
compounds, including toxic or non-biodegradable compounds. The advanced oxidation
processes are widely applied to treat many different types of wastewater. The three
AOPs usually applied are: O3, O3/H2O2, and Fenton’s reagent (Fe2+/H2O2). Ozone (O3)
Ozone is one of the strongest oxidants with a high oxidation potential (E0 =2.07V). The
oxidation potential of ozone is higher than that of oxygen (E0 =1.23 V) and hydrogen
peroxide (E0 =1.78 V), but lower than that of the hydroxyl radical OH (E0 =2.28 V).
Ozone can oxidize many organic and inorganic matters in water and wastewater. The
oxidation process may occur following two pathways: -
Direct oxidation by soluble molecular ozone O3(aq);
-
Indirect oxidation by free radicals (mainly OH) produced by the
decomposition of ozone in solution. The dissociation reaction of ozone produces oxygen and oxygen radical that are able to
oxidize complex organic molecules to simpler organic molecules which are often more
biodegradable (Lopez et al. 1998). Ozone reactions with organic matter in aqueous
systems may occur via two pathways: direct attack by molecular ozone via
cycloaddition or an electrophilic reaction; and indirect attack by free radicals (mainly
OH) produced from the decomposition of ozone(Hoigné and Bader 1976; Gurol and
Singer 1982; Masten and Davies 1994; Von Gunten et al. 1995; Von Sonntag 1996;
Beltrán et al. 1998). The direct reaction between ozone and organic molecules is described as a bimolecular
reaction. The apparent reaction rate is a first order reaction with respect to dissolved
ozone concentration and a first order reaction with respect to the organic compounds
(Hoigné and Bader 1976). 43 On the other hand, the indirect reaction between ozone and organic compounds occurs
via hydroxyl radicals generated from ozone self-decomposition. The indirect reaction is
described as a first order reaction with respect to the radical concentration, [OH] and as
a first order reaction with respect to the organic compound concentration. The equations
of ozone decomposition mechanism are described by Staehelin (1983) and Hoigné
(1998) as follows: O3 + OH- → O2- + HO2
(slow) (2.1) HO2 ↔ H + + O2- O2-  +  O3 → O3- + O2 O3-  +  H + ↔ HO3 (Fast)
HO3 → HO + O2
OH  + O3 → HO4 HO4 → HO2 + O2 (2.2)
The net reaction of ozone decomposition (eq. 2.2) is given below (eq. 2.3):
2O3 → 3O2 (2.3) The ozone process is a promising method for purification aiming for reuse of textile
wastewater, resulting in direct environmental and economic benefits. The ozone process
can be used to remove color, COD and detergents to an extent that is sufficient for water
reuse in other production processes. The conditions that are necessary to achieve this
level of purification are compatible with reasonable operation costs. Many researchers
have investigated the ozonation process for treating textile wastewater. Results
demonstrate that ozonation is very effective and fast process for decolorizing and can
easily break the double bonds present in most dyes (Groff 1992; Tzitzi et al. 1994;
Mattioli et al. 2002). In decolorizing, the application of ozone has been shown to be
very effective for soluble dyestuffs such as acid, cationic, and direct dyes, while
disperse and vat dyes (insoluble dyestuffs) were more resistant to ozone treatment
(Marmagn and Coste. 1996). However, Namboodri et al. (1994) found that complete
decolorization of red 13 and blue 60 disperse dyes was achieved in 40-60 seconds.
According to Van der Zee et al. (2001) a concentration of 50-384 µg/L of halogenated
alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbon (synthetic wastewater) could be reduced by 82% and
87% respectively, when applying an ozone dosage of 6 mg/L. In accordance with
Kabdasli et al. (2002) the color of reactive dye can be completely removed by the
ozonation process with a dosage of 1,890 mg O3/L within 30 minutes. Ciardelli and
Ranieri (2001) reported that a concentration of 30mgO3/L is sufficient to reduce color
up to 89-100% and the COD decreased 39-67% at a contact time of about 60 minutes. A
higher ozone dosage did not give a further increase of the color removal efficiency. Numerous laboratory-scale experiments have documented the feasibility of ozonating
dyeing baths effluent and reusing the decolorized effluent several times with excellent
color reproducibility. For instance, from a dye bath effluent, containing acid and 44 reactive dye 1: 2 metal complex dye, the color was decreased by 76% within a reaction
time of 2 minutes at pH 3, with a dosage of 111 mg O3/L per minute (Sevimli and
Kinaci 2002). For dye bath effluents of cotton and polyester production processes, the
reactive time was extended to 60 minutes with a high ozone dosage of 2,400 mg/L. The
color removal efficiency obtained was then 96% (Arslan et al. 2000). For dye bath
effluents of cotton, synthetic, and blended fabric manufacturing wastewater an ozone
dosage of 97 mg/L was needed with a contact time of 5 minutes to achieve a color
removal efficiency of 68% (Orhon et al. 2002). The ozone process can also be used as a post-treatment or polishing step of effluents to
meet the discharge standards or for reuse. The ozonation process produces a large quantity of potentially biodegradable by-
products (Tzitzi et al. 1994; Lopez et al. 1998; Mattioli et al. 2002; Teo et al. 2002). For
example, with application of a dosage of 2-111 mgO3/L and a contact time of 30
minutes to textile wastewater, its ratio of BOD5/COD increased from 0.52 to 0.75.
Therefore, the ozone process can be employed as preliminary stage for subsequence
biological degradation of toxic organic compounds. The main advantage of the ozonation process is that the discoloration of the wastewater
is achieved in a relatively short time and the process produces no sludge. In addition,
ozone can also remove a large proportion of absorbable organic halogens (AOX) and
inhibit and destroy foam properties of surfactants (Mattioli et al. 2002). No risks are
associated with discharge of residual ozone because ozone is unstable and decomposes
into water and oxygen. As a preliminary stage for raw textile wastewater treatment, ozone is too expensive if all
COD is to be oxidized, but it can be uses as a pre-treatment step to decolorize dyes and
decompose toxic compounds. However, some of the ozonation products, especially
aldehydes, are very toxic or carcinogenic (Lopez et al. 1998). Application of ozone for the treatment of textile industry wastewater is characterized by
high installation and operational costs. The estimated costs are between 0.11 and 0.27
€/ton textile wastewater, and could be as high as 0.55 €/ton for heavy polluted textile
wastewaters (Kaulbach 1996). According to Boncz (2002) the cost of ozone production
is about 3.5 €/kg and the amount of ozone needed for treatment is about 30-80 g/ton of
wastewater. This relatively high cost of ozone generation mainly comes from the high
consumption of energy. This is one the major drawbacks with the application of the
ozonation process with treating textile wastewater. Factors influencing the ozone process The main factors that influence the ozone process are: - Effect of pH
- Ozone dose and efficiency of ozone’s mass transfer process in water
- Effect of scavengers
- Effect of particles 45 Effect of pH The pH affects significantly the formation of by-products and the efficiency of the
oxidization process. According to Hoigné and Bader (1976) and Tuba (2001) direct
oxidation by molecular ozone is the main pathway in acid environments, whereas the
indirect oxidation by hydroxyl radicals is the main pathway in alkaline environments or
with the presence of agents like H2O2, UV, and catalysts. The reactive oxidation rate
increases due to the formation of free radicals according to eq. (2.1). Several researches
(Hoigné and Bader 1976; Sotelo et al. 1989; Hoigné 1998; Elovitz et al. 2000; Boncz
2002) remark that free valence radical formation are the fastest at pH  8 and the
treatment efficiency decreases at that pH due to the loss a large proportion of ozone
through self-decomposing at high pH. Ozone dose and efficiency ozone’s mass transfer in water Complete dissolution of ozone into the liquid phase depends on mass transfer. The mass
transfer of ozone from the gas phase to the liquid phase can be ineffective when part of
the supplied ozone is not dissolved in the liquid and remains in the gas phase. In order
to reinforce the treatment efficiency, ozone is supplied to the wastewater in very fine
bubbles. The consumption of ozone per unit of wastewater can be used to compare the
treatment efficiency of this process among the different wastewaters. When the reaction rate starts to reduce and by-products are created, the dissolved ozone
concentration will increase up to a point where it will no further dissolve in the
wastewater. Therefore the ozone concentration in the gas phase increases. This is considered as an
optimal endpoint for the ozone oxidation to avoid supplying excessive quantities of
ozone. Effect of scavengers Textile wastewater contains in general a high concentration of several inorganic
substances like Na2CO3, NaCl, and Na3PO4. These salts are known to be radical
scavengers (Hoigné and Bader 1976; Neta et al. 1988; Acero and Von Gunten 2000).
The scavengers react with OH (see equation 2.4 and 2.5) wasting a certain amount of
OH. The lower OH concentration decreases the efficiency of the oxidation process. OH  +  CO3
2- →  CO3-  + OH- (k = 4.2.108 M-1s-1) (2.4)
O2- + CO3- →  CO3
2- + O2 (k = 7.5.108 M-1s-1) (2.5) Bicarbonate ions are also seen as scavenging radicals and are involved in ozone
decomposition according to Tri and Trung (2005). The equation between OH and
HCO3
- is given below: OH  + HCO3
- → HCO3- + OH- (k = 1.5.107 M-1s-1) (2.6) 46 In experiments aimed to measure the influence of chloride in the oxidation process, Liao
et al (2001) discovered that the chloride ion had almost no effect on decomposition of
ozone. The reaction between chloride ions and hydroxyl radicals is presented in
equation 2.7. OH  +  Cl- →  ClOH- (k = 8.9.107 M-1s-1) (2.7) The reaction rate constant (k) of the reaction between OH and CO3
2- (eq. 2.4) is much
higher than the reaction rate constant of reaction between OH and HCO3
- (eq. 2.6). The
textile wastewater usually has a very high (>8.3) or low pH (<4.5). At high pH the
equilibrium between bicarbonate and carbonate will create the strong scavenger
carbonate, causing a negative effect on the oxidation process. While at low pH the
formed carbonic acid (H2CO3) does not scavengeh hydroxyl radicals. In order to avoid
inhibition of carbonate and bicarbonate ions on the ozonation process, the pH is best
adjusted to acid conditions. According to Boncz (2002) carbonate ions will be formed
by the reaction of CO3- and O2- (eq. 2.5) since the reaction rate constant k is much
higher than of that of the reaction presented in equation (2.4). As a consequence the
presence carbonate ions in solution will increase the consumption of ozone and decrease
the efficiency of AOPs. According to Hoigne’(1998) carbonate and bicarbonate ions most often inhibit the
ozonation rate, while phosphate and nitrate ions inhibit to a much lower degree. The
reactions between NO3
- and PO4
3- with OH are: OH  +  NO3
- →  OH-  + NO3 (k < 5.105 M-1s-1) (2.8)
OH  +  PO4
3- →  OH-  + PO42- (k < 1.107 M-1s-1) (2.9) Influence of particles
Particles, including suspended solid and colloidal particles, present in wastewater
significantly affect the ozonation process by decreasing contact between molecular
ozone or hydroxyl radicals and dyestuffs. Besides, insoluble dyestuffs present as
colloidal particles in wastewater could be oxidized to a soluble form by ozone or other
oxidants in a treatment process resulting in an increase of the consumption of ozone or
reaction time. H2O2/O3 The ozone mass transfer from the gas to the liquid phase can often be insufficient
because the supplied ozone is not completely dissolved into the liquid phase. In such
cases hydrogen peroxide addition may improve the conversion of ozone into radicals. In
the H2O2/O3 process only the indirect oxidation by free radicals OH will occur which
yields mostly nonselective oxidation of complex substances. Hydrogen peroxide is also
seen as a precursor compound for the decomposition of ozone by means of HO2
- (eq.
2.10). HO2
- will increase the rate of radical formation as is given in the equation 2.11. H2O2 + H2O ↔ HO2
- + H3O+ (2.10) HO2
- + O3 → O3- + HO2 (2.11) 47 In a subsequent reaction, the O3
- and HO2 radicals will continue to form the hydroxyl
radicals (2.2). A net reaction is represented by H2O2/O3 as follows: H2O2 + 2O3 → 2OH + 3O2 (2.12) Influence of H2O2 dosage
Similar as with ozonation, the H2O2/O3 process is also affected by many factors like pH,
colloidal particles, and the presence of scavenging substances as mentioned above. In
addition, the H2O2 dosage significantly affects the H2O2/O3 oxidation process. The
required dosage of H2O2 dosage depends on the scavenger nature and concentration in
the wastewater. However, H2O2 in excess can cause decreased oxidation efficiency
because H2O2 can also act as a scavenger (eq. 2.13). OH  + H2O2 → H2O + HO2 (2.13) Fenton’s reagent Fenton’s reagent is seen as a quite effective method for decolorization and COD
removal for several textile effluents. In the Fenton’s reaction, free hydroxyl radicals
(OH) are formed from H2O2 addition in to an acidic environment (pH<5) containing
iron ions (normally as Fe2+). The main removal of COD and color in the Fenton’s
reaction has to be attributed to the oxidation process by the highly reactive radicals
(such as hydroxyl radicals) and the coagulation process with Fe(OH)3 co-precipitation.
The reaction equations are mentioned below. Fe2+ + H2O2 → Fe3+ + OH- + OH (2.14) The reaction rate constant k1 of reaction (2.14) is 63 M-1.s-1 (Gallard and De Laat 2001). Fe3+ + H2O2 → Fe2+ + H+ + HO2 (2.15) The reaction rate constant k2 of reaction (2.15) is  3*10-3 M-1.s-1 (Pignatello 1992). From the reaction rate constants k1 and k2 can be derived that in steady state [Fe2+] will
be 21,000 [Fe3+] as is explained below. k1[Fe2+] [H2O2] = k2[Fe3+] [H2O2]
[Fe3+] = k1 / k2 [Fe2+]
[Fe3+] = 21,000[Fe2+] In addition, the formed hydroxyl radical (eq. 2.14) can react again with Fe2+ and H2O2
as is shown in the reaction equation (2.16) and (2.17). Especially OH can react with
organic compounds and creates highly reactive organic radicals as show in equation
(2.18). 48 H+
OH  +  Fe2+ → OH-  +  Fe3+ (2.16)
OH +  H2O2 → H2O  +  HO2 (2.17)
OH + RH → R + H2O (2.18) The organic radicals R are reduced or oxidized or di-merized as shown in equation
(2.19), (2.20) and (2.21). R  + Fe2+ → Fe3+  +  RH (2.19)
R  + Fe3+ (a) → Fe2+  +  R +  then R + + H2O   ROH + H+  (b) (2.20 a+b)
R  + R  → R2 (di-mer) (2.21) The radical HO2 (eq. 2.17) can react with Fe2+ and Fe3+ according to the following
equations: HO2 + Fe3+ → H+ + O2 + Fe2+ (2.22)
HO2  + Fe2+ → HO2
-  +  Fe3+ (2.23) The hydroxyl radical produced in the Fenton’s reaction, can completely decompose
recalcitrant and hazardous organics into harmless components. Fenton’s reagent is
regarded as a quite effective and economical method for decolorization and COD
removal of several dyestuffs (Kuo 1992; Bharat and Sanjeev 2007).
Factors influencing Fenton’s reagent There are four main factors that influence Fenton’s reagent, which are pH, ratio of H2O2
and Fe2+, temperature, and scavengers (inorganic anions). Influence of pH
The pH can significantly affect the decomposition of H2O2 and solubility of iron. The
solubility of iron ions depends on the environmental conditions. In an acid environment,
Fe3+ is easily reduced to Fe2+ by H2O2 (eq. 2.15), with the advantage of hydroxyl radical
(OH) creation by reaction (2.14). At a high pH precipitation of Fe3+ as Fe(OH)3 occurs
faster than the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ as according to reaction (2.15), H2O2 is then
decomposed into oxygen and water. Results of Kuo (1992), Solozhenko et al. (1995),
Shyh and Chang (1997), Park et al. (1999), Danilo et al. (2006); Bharat and Sanjeev
(2007) show that the oxidation process with Fenton’s reagent is optimal in a pH range
of 2.8-4.0. Influence of H2O2 : Fe2+ratio In Fenton’s reagent, the concentration of H2O2 and Fe2+ influences the reaction rate as
mentioned in equation (2.14). Fe2+ and H2O2 not only react to form hydroxyl radicals,
OH, according to equation (2.14) but also the reactions (2.16) and (2.17) occur wasting
just formed OH. Several studies have proposed the existence of an optimal H2O2: Fe2+
ratio for Fenton’s reagent. However, literature results show large differences in the
H2O2: Fe2+ ratio. According to Pérez et al. (2002), Solozhenko (1995), Ruppert et al.
(1994), Bauer and Fallmann Bauer (1997), and Kuo (1992) the ratio of H2O2: Fe2+
varies from 0.15:1 to 400:1. Sevimli and Kinaci (2002) found with a dosage of 300 mg 49 H2O2/L and 250 mg/L ferrous sulfate (1.5:1) a color removal efficiency of 98 and 99.7%
of synthetic wastewater containing respectively RO -16 and AR -337 dyestuffs. An
increase in dosage to 500 mg H2O2/L, and 600 mg/L ferrous sulfate (0.8:1) obtained
removal efficiencies of 91% for color and COD of a dye bath effluent with reactive and
acid dyes. According to Kuo (1992) synthetic wastewater with 0.3 g of total dyestuffs/L
(direct, disperse, basis, reactive, and acid dyes) and real wastewater gave similar results:
a removal efficiency of 88-90% for COD and 97% for color. The dosages of H2O2 and
ferrous sulfate were largely altered for each dyestuff: 292 up to 857 mg H2O2/L and 83
up to 500 mg ferrous sulfate/L (ratio 1.7:1 - 3.5:1). Hsueh et al. (2005) found that the degradation degree of organic substances increases as
H2O2 and ferrous dosage increases until an optimal dosage is achieved. An excess of
H2O2, and Fe2+ could give the opposite results. The required H2O2 dose depends on the
pollutant concentration, such as the COD load and color intensity of the wastewater.
Schwarzer and Greor (1993) found that in practice, the mol ratio of H2O2 and COD is
often in the range of 0.5-1.0. The optimal ratio of H2O2 and Fe2+ usually has to be
determined in practice for each wastewater. Influence of temperature
When temperature increases the efficiency of Fenton’s oxidation is raised. This effect is
most clear below 500C. However, if the temperature is above 500C the efficiency of the
Fenton’s reaction decreases because H2O2 decomposes to oxygen and water at higher
temperatures. According to Kuo (1992), Solozhenko (1995), Sevimli and Kinaci (2002)
decolorization of Fenton’s oxidation is affected by temperature; the proper temperature
is lower than 500C. With application of Fenton’s oxidation to wastewater with a high concentration of
organic pollutants or wastewater at high temperature the H2O2 is either consumed and
converted into CO2 or lost due to evaporation. Both situations are not favorable for
economical reasons. The temperature in range of 30-400C is the best. Depending on the textile wastewater, Fenton’s oxidation can efficiently (70-99%)
decolorize almost all dyestuffs such as reactive, direct, metal complex, pigment, acid,
base, disperse, and vat dyes (Kuo 1992; Groff 1992; Shyh 1997; Bharat and Sanjeev
2007). In comparison with the ozonation process, the Fenton’s process is relatively
cheap and results generally in high COD removal efficiencies of 50-88%. A drawback
of Fenton’s reagent application is that many kinds of chemicals are used, resulting in
high operational costs. Besides, the amount of generated sludge with Fenton’s reagent
application adds costs for handling and disposal of this hazardous sludge. Influence of scavengers Salts like Na2CO3, NaCl, and Na3PO4 are often present at high concentrations in textile
wastewater and are known radial scavengers. However, because the Fenton’s reagent is
applied at low pH (<5), these salts hardly affect the removal efficiency of Fenton’s
reagent. At low pH the carbonate, bicarbonate is converted into CO2. Chloride ions are
also reported to have a very small radical scavenging effect. 50 2.2.4 The recovery of valuable products (membrane technology)
Membrane technology is receiving more and more attention and will likely play a key
role in the industry’s ongoing efforts to minimize water usage. Its advantages include
reduction of the volume of wastewater, and recovery and recycling of valuable
components from the wastewater streams or recovery of thermal energy from hot
wastewaters, apart from producing effluents that meet discharge standards. In addition,
this process occupies has only a small area requirement. According to Stephenson et al.(2000), a membrane can be thought of as a material
through which one type of substance can pass more readily than others, thus presenting
the basis of a separation process. Membrane processes are filtration in which the pore
size of the membrane is of molecular dimensions. These pore sizes are controlled and
determined during the manufacture of membrane material. According to Afarias and
Farias (1997) microfiltration (MF) membranes have pore sizes that are capable of
separating colloidal particles from dissolved polymers. Ultra-filtration (UF) membranes
separate polymers and colloidal matter from soluble low molecular weight molecules.
Nano-filtration membranes allow the partitioning of divalent ions from monovalent
ions. Finally, reverse osmosis (RO) membrane only water permeates and the presence of
colloidal particles will cause fouling of the membranes. Most commercial membranes are made with an asymmetric cross section, with the
smallest hole facing the feed solution and an open structure downstream. This feature
prevents the membrane pores from blocking as would occur in a depth filter. Unlike
ordinary filters, membrane processes are operated with a strong cross-flow that is
tangential to the membrane surface. The membranes can usually be chemically cleaned
to a nearly new condition. Typical membrane life is two to three years depending on
characteristics of wastewater (Sójka-Ledakowicz et al. 1998; Ciardelli et al. 2001;
Koyuncu et al. 2004; Zheng and Liu 2006). Processes to recover water, auxiliary chemicals and energy of textile dyestuffs
wastewater have been used widely in the recent years because of a potential shortage of
water. Since 1986 Separem has developed membrane processes for reuse of textile
effluents. Membrane processes may be applied to different textile wastewater streams
like washing, dying, bleaching, printing, finishing wastewater, etc. Membrane processes can treat varying flows of wastewater, from a few cubic meters to
thousands of cubic meters per day. Membrane techniques have been employed in South
Africa for removal of reactive dyes. With adaptation of the reactive dyeing process the
permeate from the membrane separation process, containing some of the auxiliary
chemicals, could be reused. In order to recycle these chemicals, specific rejection
characteristics are demanded of the membrane process used, which in this case was
based on nano-filtration membranes (Erswell et al. 1988). Koyuncu (2002) evaluated
the suitability of nano-filtration membranes for separating COD, color and electric
conductivity increasing matter from textile effluent containing acid, disperse, and metal
complex dyes at a flow of 1,200 m3/day. The overall removal efficiency of COD, color
and conductivity was higher than 97%. The ingoing feed COD was about 550-720
mg/L, the effluent COD was lower than 10 mg/L at an applied pressure of 10 bar. The
COD of the permeate decreased with increasing cross membrane pressure and increased 51 with increasing recovery. Almost a complete color removal was achieved with the nano-
filtration application, color intensity decreased to 10 Pt-Co. This significant reduction in
color and COD makes reuse of the permeate in other processes of the textile production
processes possible. Total estimated treatment costs would be 0.81 US$/m3. According
to Buckley (1992), a full scale nano-filtration facility treating reactive dye liquors from
a medium sized (200 m3/month) cotton dye process applying a conservative design flux
of 10L/m2h, should recuperate the capital investment within three years. The amount of
electrolytes (sodium chloride or sodium sulfate) discharged would be decreased by
more than 90%. Afarias and Farias (1997) demonstrated on pilot scale a combination of
ultra-filtration and nano-filtration, enabled repeated recycling of water and salts for
starting a bath for new dyeing. Soluble dye classes like acid, metal complex, direct, basic or cationic and reactive dyes
can be separated by reverse osmosis. A return on investment costs within three years for
ultra filtration/reverse osmosis (RO) membrane treatment of 1,000 m3/day of textile
wastewaters was calculated based on reduced costs of salts, water, and sewer services
(Ciardelli et al. 2001). The reverse osmosis plant was constructed with two stages, each
comprising six spiral wrap elements. The quality of the produced permeates compared
favorably with tap water. In dyeing trials 200,000 m of fabric was dyed using the
reverse osmosis permeate with no discernible effect on the dyeing quality (Buckley
1992). However, the application of membrane technologies remains limited. Membrane
treatment produces a highly concentrated waste streams and the treatment of these by
current methods such as evaporation or discharge into the ocean are either economically
or environmentally unacceptable. Another important drawback is that the capital costs
of the membrane process are high. The costs of treating or preventing membrane fouling
are also high. Additionally a reasonable level of expertise is required. It can be
concluded that this technology is currently not suitable for the textile industry of
Vietnam. 2.2.5 Biological processes Biological removal of dyestuffs is based on microbial biotransformation of dyes. Two
biological processes are applied to treat textile wastewater: anaerobic (UASB) and
aerobic (activated sludge) processes. The aerobic activated sludge process is widely
used in textile wastewater treatment. A combination of an anaerobic and aerobic process
is applied to remove the pollutants completely. The anaerobic process is the first step to
reduce the molecular dyes into aromatic amines (color removal) and the second aerobic
step is used as a polishing step to meet requirements. Aerobic process Conventional suspended activated aerobic sludge and attached sludge processes are
widely used for textile wastewaters. The activated sludge process performs very well for
BOD removal but is almost ineffective for color removal (Altinbas et al. 1995; O'Neill
et al. 1999; Hu 2001; Panswad et al. 2001; Mattioli et al. 2002). The color removal
occurs mainly as adsorption on the sludge (Mattioli et al. 2002). The mechanism of dye 52 removal includes two phases. The first phase involves rapid adsorption of the dye onto
mycellial pellets and the second slow phase involves biodegradation. According to Van
der Zee (2002) the electron withdrawing nature of the azo dye linkages is blocking
oxygen attack resulting in ineffective in dye removal. Thus the aerobic process alone
can not achieve an effluent color that meets discharge standards. A combination of the
aerobic process with other techniques is often applied for achieving these standards. In
presence of specific oxygen catalyzed catalytic enzymes, some aerobic bacteria are able
to reduce azo compounds and produce aromatic amines (Stolz 2001). One of the drawbacks of the activated sludge system is that it produces a large amount
of sludge, which has to be further treated, increasing operational costs. Another
drawback of the aerobic process is the large energy consumption for aeration.  In
addition, the aerobic process is not suited for enterprise with small areas availability
because a large area is needed for an aerobic treatment facility. Anaerobic process
Azo dyes account for 60-70% of all used dyestuffs and pigments in processing textile.
Most decolorization of azo dyes occurs when the chromophore bond in molecule is
cleaved. Under anaerobic conditions this cleaving generates intermediates such as
aromatic amines and decolorization of dyes does not mean a significant reduction of
COD (Hao 2000). The exact mechanism of the anaerobic azo dye reduction is not
clearly understood yet and mechanisms are proposed (Gingell and Walker 1971; Haug
et al. 1991; Carliell et al. 1995; Razo et al. 1996; Kudlich et al. 1997; Van der Zee et al.
2000). Although many anaerobic microorganisms are capable cleaving chromophores and
auxochromes bonds of some dyes, only few can mineralize dyes to CO2 and H2O, most
likely due to the complex structure of the dyes. A precondition for the reduction of azo
dyes is the presence of a co-substrate acting as an electron donor (Nigam et al. 1996).
Many different co-substrates are suitable electron donors, ranging from tapioca to
sugars and volatile fatty acids (Carliell et al. 1995; Nigam et al. 1996; Donlon et al.
1997; Chiwekitvanich et al. 2000; Van der Zee et al. 2000; Willetts and Ashbolt 2000). The rate of azo-reduction depends on the type of co-substrate and/or on the chemical
structure of the azo dyes. Azo dye reduction leads to formation of aromatic amines and
these were found to accumulate under anaerobic conditions (Brown and Laboureur
1983; Field et al. 1995). Cervantes et al. (2001b) reported  soluble COD and color removal efficiency of about
85%, at steady state conditions at a loading rate of 5.3 g COD/L.day, using 100 mg
AO7/L (acid orange 7) as substrate in an upflow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor.
Athanasopoulos (1992) also used an UASB on laboratory scale treating the desizing and
scouring wastewater from a cotton blending factory. The maximum COD loading rate
was 2.5 g COD/L.day with COD removal ranging from 60-90%.
An anaerobic pre treatment offers several potential advantages such as better removal of
color, AOX, and heavy metals (through precipitation). 53 Compared with aerobic systems that need expensive aeration and have problems with
bulking sludge, anaerobic treatment may present a cheaper alternative. This gives the
anaerobic digestion process a potential economic advantage. The anaerobic process has
the capacity for high organic loading rate and low nutrient wastewater treatment and
with the possibility of reductive dye decolourisation. Anaerobic treatment is a promising
technology for integrated wastewater treatment in the textile industry.
A major drawback of anaerobic process is the formation of aromatic amines, which are
more toxic to the environment than the azo dyes. Another drawback is the odor from
anaerobic degradation of organic mater. In treating textile wastewater a biological
system needs to be capable to deal with the varying composition of the wastewater
which can change rapidly. In addition, some dyes are quite toxic to microorganisms.
The low bacterial yield in anaerobic systems, compared to aerobic systems, could in
practice show a decrease of removal efficiencies on real textile wastewater. To degrade
dyestuff into aromatic amines the hydraulic retention time needs to be high. The
aromatic amines tend to accumulate in an anaerobic system.
Combined anaerobic and aerobic processes
The combination of anaerobic and aerobic process has proven its effectiveness in
research studies. The first step is the anaerobic process to reduce the molecular dyes
into aromatic amines (color removal) and the aerobic step polishes the anaerobic
effluent to meet requirements. Jianrong et al. (1994) achieved for a high strength
effluent of dye manufacturing plant a 90% COD reduction and 96% color reduction in a
laboratory scale UASB reactor at a HRT of 8 hours, followed by an activated sludge
reactor at a HRT of 6 hours. Zaoyan et al. (1992) operated a large pilot plant (24m3/day) for 9 months at a textile
dyeing mill which used reactive dye and other dye class on polyester/cotton fabric. The
treatment consisted of two multi stage rotating biological contactors. The anaerobic
process, with a HRT of 7 hours and an organic loading rate of 2 g COD/day.m3 was
followed by the aerobic polishing step. The combined anaerobic/aerobic system
achieved a color removal efficiency of 72%. The aerobic system alone showed a color
removal efficiency of <60%. The final effluent of the combined treatment system was
still deeply colored. Both the single and the combined system achieved 78% COD
removal efficiency; the remaining COD was 150 mg/L, a 95% BOD5 removal efficiency
(13 mg/L) and 70% anionic surfactants removal efficiency (0.7 mg/L). In general, the
sequential anaerobic/aerobic systems are not capable to produce effluents that satisfy
regulations. 2.2.6 Combined physical-chemical, chemical, and biological processes Difficulties with treatment of textile wastewater are assumed to be caused by the
complex composition of textile wastewater with its wide variety of dyestuffs, auxiliary,
and basic chemical used in the textile manufacturing processes. The use of an individual
treatment process may not completely decolorize, degrade organic matter and remove
other chemicals in the textile wastewater, because each treatment process can only
remove some compounds from the wastewater. In order to meet discharge standards, a
combination of physical, physical-chemical, chemical, and biological techniques has to 54 be developed. A combined physical/chemical and aerobic treatment or aerobic and
physical/chemical treatment has proved its effectiveness in research studies and in
practice. However, with more strict standards for color and COD it is difficult to
achieve an effluent that meets these standards. For instance, combining an aerobic
process with a subsequent chemical oxidation process like ozone or the Fenton’s reagent
process, the aim is to remove readily biodegradable compounds with biological process,
and remove the non-biodegradable or toxic compounds with the chemical oxidation.
Sequential treatment by chemical oxidation and aerobic treatment also offers a feasible
measure. The chemical oxidation step improves the biodegradability of refractory
organic compounds and decolorization of the dyestuffs and breaks down toxicant matter
into less toxic matter. The subsequent aerobic treatment can then obtain a high
efficiency. A process comprising pre-treatment with precipitation/flocculation,
biological treatment and a post-treatment unit with reverse osmosis can recover 80% of
wastewater, chemical and energy from effluent of textile enterprises (Gaeta and Fedele
1991). For treatment of effluent from textile enterprises, an application involving
activated sludge oxidation, sand filtration, ultra filtration and reverse osmosis can
achieved reuse wastewater without problems since the quality of water presently used in
textile wet processes (Ciardelli et al. 2001). The choice for a combined treatment
scheme depends on the composition, discharge standards, economic conditions, and on
the purpose of reuse of the recycled wastewater. 2.2.7 Separating wastewater streams In the textile industry, almost all processes generate high volumes of wastewater. The
amount and composition of the wastewater depends on the process, machine and the
type of fiber (cotton, polyester, nylon, blends of cotton/polyester). Quantity and
composition of the wastewaters vary widely with amounts ranging from 40-300 m3 per
ton product (Boncz, 2002) in which 75% of the total water consumption is related to
rinsing processes. Most rinsing steps are high in consumption of water and produce low
pollution concentrations. Wet processes of the textile industry include three main steps:
preparation, dying and finishing. The preparation step uses basic chemicals like acid,
base and detergents. Different dyes, salts and chemical auxiliary are used for the dying
step. Some types of organic matter like softeners and surfactants are applied in the
finishing step. The difficulties with the treatment of wastewater and the high costs
mainly arise from the presence of a mixture of all these components in the wastewater
stream, making a single treatment process ineffective to reach discharge standards. A
combination of several treatment processes is necessary to achieve an effluent that
satisfies the requirements of environmental regulation. In a complete treatment system,
however, all pollutants have to pass through the whole system although each step of the
combined process is designed to remove some compounds from the wastewater.
Separating wastewater streams is applied with the purpose to achieve high treatment
efficiency due to the effects of undesirable compounds for that specific separate
treatment process. The separation of wastewater streams enables treating each
wastewater stream in an optimal way. The reuse of wastewater (rinsing wastewater) or
recovery of chemicals (special basic chemicals, and salts) can reduce production costs. A drawback of wastewater separation in an enterprise is that the investments for a
draining system is expensive, complicated. Operation of several and diverse wastewater
treatment systems is not easy and it needs expertise. 55 2.3 Cleaner production At present, the end-of-pipe technology is not the sole solution to protect the
environment against industrial pollution. Pollution and waste prevention at the source is
an equally important environmental strategy for industry to reduce the adverse impacts
of production on the environment, often brought together under the notion of cleaner
production.  Cleaner production has been recognized as a desirable strategy, both
environmentally and economically. The concept originated in Europe during the 1970s,
in an effort to promote “low and no waste” technology, and was later combined with
ideas of sustainable development at a company level (Fresner 1998). Later, in the 1990s
cleaner production became especially important for developing countries that are
rapidly expanding their industrial production, as it was believed to present an
opportunity to invest relatively cheaply in environmentally sound production now,
rather than later paying heavily for waste treatment operations. Experiments in Western
Europe and developing countries demonstrated that in the long run, pollution prevention
through waste minimization or cleaner production are more cost effective and
environmentally sound than traditional end-of-pipe pollution control measures. The
European Commission (1998) reported “Cleaner technologies for Waste Minimization”
has shown that it is feasible and economic to apply cleaner production in food products,
beverage manufacturing, pulp & paper mills, textile and clothing production and wood
and furniture manufacturing. In order to stimulate the development and implementation
of cleaner production many developing countries established Cleaner Production
Centers in the 1990s. According to the Vietnam Cleaner Production Center and Vietnam
textile industry group- VNCPC and VINATEX (2002), Vietnam’s textile industry has
an enormous potential to apply cleaner production, with more efficient energy and raw
material use, lower emission levels and reduction of production costs. It is estimated
that 30-50% of all current wastes and emissions from the Vietnamese textile industry
can be prevented at the source by the use of environmentally sound and economically
profitable cleaner production procedures. 2.3.1 Cleaner production theory
The Cleaner Production Program of the United Nations Environmental Program UNEP
defined cleaner production (CP) in 1996 as: “The continuous application of an
integrated preventive environmental strategy applied to processes, products and services
in order to increase efficiency and reduce risks to humans and environment” (UNEP
1996). The Australian cleaner production programme defined cleaner production
slightly different, but with the same connotation: “a strategy to continuously improve
products, services and processes to reduce environmental impacts and work towards
ecologically and economically sustainable development”(Environmental Australia
1997). There are differences between cleaner production concepts in different countries
(Maica 1996). However, from an environmental point of view most of these definitions
have major similarities: cleaner production helps to efficiently use raw materials and
energy, eliminate toxic raw materials, and reduce the quantity and toxicity of all
emissions and wastes. Other concepts similar to cleaner production are waste
minimization, pollution prevention, and green productivity; these concepts share some
fundamental ideas with cleaner production. The goal of cleaner production is to
minimize environmental impacts by changing either the way goods or services are
produced (process technology) or the products themselves (product design). 56 Environmental risks are reduced as the total amount of waste generated and the harmful
substances are reduced. In addition, cleaner production is also seen as one of the
building blocks of an industrial ecology approach (see below). Therefore, cleaner
production has gained in importance in industry and in governmental policy to control
pollution. It is important to stress that cleaner production is not only simply a question
of changing equipment, but it is also a matter of changing management, attitudes, know-
how, and improving the manufacturing process as well as the product composition. Cleaner production can be applied to any manufacturing processes and ranges from
relatively easy operational changes to more comprehensive transformations of product
design and production processes. Cleaner production can be divided into three main
groups/strategies, to be elaborated below: -
Waste reduction at source
-
Recycling
-
Product modification
2.3.2 Waste reduction at source
The fundamental idea of cleaner production is going to the source of pollution and
maximizes pollution reduction at that place. This practice of waste reduction at the
source is comprised 5 main options (EPA 1997; VNCPC 2002; VNCPC and VINATEX
2002): good housekeeping, better process control, material substitution, equipment
modification, and new process technology. These will be described in more detail
below. Good housekeeping
Good housekeeping includes the relatively most simple strategy and set of measures
within the cleaner production approach. It does not require outlays or high technology.
The options and measures of good housekeeping do not require advanced technological
innovations or drastic rescheduling of productions/product designs, but involve regular
maintenance of pipes, valves, pumps; the closing of water taps; and turning off
equipment when not used to avoid leakage and loss of water, energy and raw materials.
Through good housekeeping practices, companies can improve production efficiency,
prevent pollution without changing industrial processes and products, and reduce
production costs. For the textile industry, good regular maintenance and housekeeping
can reduce 10-20% water and energy usage (VNCPC and VINATEX 2002). In good
housekeeping, the role of employees is a decisive success factor. So training and
incentive programs are key success elements in good housekeeping, and good
communication lines between departments in a company prove essential. Many options found in cleaner production practices are good housekeeping measures.
For instance, the report on the Consultative group cleaner production project with 13
companies in Styria, Austria, showed that 50% of all cleaner production options are not
technical measures, but related to organization and good housekeeping (Fresner 1998).
According to the Vietnam Cleaner Production Center, VNCPC (2004), 26% of cleaner
production options carried out in the Vietnamese textile industry could be labeled as
good housekeeping. 57 Better process control
Better process control measures optimize production conditions to achieve efficient
consumption of raw materials and minimize waste generation. Optimizing process
control via scheduling dyeing operation to minimize machine cleaning, proper
maintenance of production equipment, identification of unnecessary washing of both
grey materials and equipment (EPA 1997), and dyeing recipe optimization leads to a
reduction of both chemical consumption and pollution load to the drain during the
production process. This improves production efficiency and maintains low operation
costs. Influential process control factors for dyeing processes include temperature, time,
pressure, pH, processing speed; these all have to be monitored and regulated to optimize
dying conditions. Bortone et al. (1997) claims that it is possible to reduce water
consumption in wet processes with 5-10%, simply with changes in such operation
procedures. Material substitution Material substitution changes toxic raw and auxiliary materials for less harmful ones, or
ones that can be used more efficiently, or raw materials that can be recycled internally
or externally. One of the purposes of material substitution is to prevent more pollution
material ending up in the wastewater and thus to reduce the emission of pollutants to the
environment. Opportunities for material substitution vary substantially among
enterprises, because of differences in process conditions, products and raw materials
(EPA 1997). For example, hydrochloride, which is used during the bleaching processes,
is substituted with hydrogen peroxide to reduce total dissolved solids and improve
fabric quality before dyeing. This reduces the emission of toxic materials to the
environment. Another example: reactive dyes, a low fixation dye (60-90%), and the use
of low quality salts, can be substitutes for dyes with high fixation (90-95%) and high
quality salt. This results in a reduction in the consumption of salt from 0.63 to 0.45
kg/kg fabric (Narayanaswamy and Scott 2001). The material substitution can be carried
out easily because it does not require large investments and it significantly reduces toxic
chemical emissions. Equipment modification Equipment modification retrofits or modifies the existing equipment and introduces
automation in production processes, to minimize raw material loss, water use and
energy use (EPA 1997; Bortone 1997). In many cases, modifying equipment can
provide source reduction by reducing the ratio of water and chemicals to textile goods
(EPA 1997). Options for modifying equipment include installing automated dosing
systems and dye machine controllers.
New process technology
This solution installs modern equipment in terms of enhanced resource productivity,
which as a result reduces waste and emission, and establishes best practice techniques.
With the application of new process technology the consumption of water and energy
can be decreased significantly, and the potential for saving on raw materials and
improving product quality is large. An example of a new production process is the 58 replacement of winch for soft flow (jig) technology. The typical bath liquor to fabric
ratio for winch dyeing varies from 17:1 to 14:1, and for soft flow dyeing it varies from
only 7:1 to 5:1. Thereby it reduces water consumption by respectively 30% and 50%.
Another example is to install a new boiler with a higher efficiency, which will reduce
the energy consumption with 10-20%. However, new process technology options
usually require higher investments than other cleaner production options. 2.3.3 Reuse/Recycling
Generated waste streams from production process can be recycled/re-used on-site or
off-site an enterprise. Recycling/reuse is an excellent way for an enterprise to save
costs, reduce waste, and often save energy. On-site recycling/reuse uses waste from one
process and reuses it in the same or another production process. A simple example of
the on-site reuse is wastewater of the last washing phase from a dyeing process that is
reused in earlier washing phases. Out-site recycling/reuse puts external recycling
networks to work to achieve less (or even zero) emission. For instance, wasted solvents
can be collected and sold to enterprises that separate these solvents from a waste stream,
purify them and sell them to other consumers. Although the recycling/reuse activities do
not directly prevent pollution, these activities might be seen as effective measures to
minimize pollution entering the environment. 2.3.4 Product modification Product modification changes the characteristics of products. Products become less
polluting, their lifetime may be expanded, and/or they are easier to repair. Product
modification is a fundamental part of cleaner production. This practice includes two
parts: - Changes in products through the improvement of product design, such as its
shape and material composition. This option can include large savings on
consumption of materials, and reduction in the use of hazardous chemicals.
- Changes in product packaging in order to minimize pollution. An example of product modification is to design products with light color instead of
dark color; or replacing plastic packing for recycled cardboard.
2.3.5 Benefits of cleaner production/pollution prevention The success of cleaner production brings benefits for the company and for society. The
benefits for the company relate to: reduction of costs spent on production, improvement
of the working environment, and compliance with environmental regulation. In
addition, with a cleaner production approach the company can open new market
opportunities, for instance by creating favorable conditions for the implementation of
accredited environmental management systems (e.g. ISO 14001), which will give
companies better access to export markets. The benefits for society include improved
environmental quality and sustainable development. According to UNEP(1997),
application of cleaner production can decrease the amount waste produced by a
company with 10-30%. Case studies from various countries give evidence of such
successes. Petek and Glavic (1996) reports on successful waste minimization measures
in textile enterprises in Denmark, where good housekeeping, better process control, and 59 equipment modification, reduced the pollution load with 25% (15,3000 m3/year) in
wastewater, 24% (7,300 kg/year) for dyes, and 14% for textile auxiliary and basic
chemicals (73,800 kg/year). The production costs of textile could be reduced with 6 %
after the implementation of clear production. Fresner (1998) showed that cleaner
production was also successful in the Austrian textile industry. The application of good
housekeeping, on-side recycling/reuse, material substitution, and better process control
helped to reduce water use with 20%, limited the discharge of large volumes of
wastewater and chemicals into environment, and saved a company 200,000 US$ per
year. Implementation of cleaner production in Indian hosiery clusters (containing eight
integrated hosiery mills) saved production costs between 8-10 cents per T-shirt. The
quantity of water and energy consumed was reduced between 30-50% through new
process technology. Beside these economic benefits, the application of cleaner
production improved the environmental performance of the eight Indian mills (Sakurai
1995). Cleaner production is also gaining importance in China. Every year China
publishes a list of best practical techniques for cleaner production and takes
administrative and economic measures to urge enterprises to apply and implement
cleaner production (Warren et al. 1999). A dyeing and finishing factory located in
Taichung County, China, had implemented a cleaner production program with new
process technology, recycling/reuse, and better process control options. This factory
gained 10.7% additional profit each year, mainly by reducing water, energy and
chemical consumption (Sakurai 1995). Kamipai Textile Company is classified as a large
textile factory in Indonesia. With the application of cleaner production options such as
good housekeeping, new process technology, and on-side recycling/reuse it reduced
30% of water and 20% of energy consumption (Sakurai 1995). These benefits are also true for the textile industry in Vietnam, as illustrated in Table
2.1. According to annual report of Vietnam Cleaner Production Center (2006) the
number of textile enterprises that implemented cleaner production between 1999 and
2004 was 34, out of a total of 2,000 Vietnamese textile and garment enterprises. These
Vietnamese demonstration projects show that implementation of cleaner production by
applying simple low-cost options brings not only economic benefits by reducing costs
with 50-80 US$/ton product, but also obtain environmental benefits by decreasing the
pollution load. Figure 2.2 shows the division of CP options adopted at 34 textile
enterprises in Vietnam. Better process control and good housekeeping were the most
often implemented options, with 45% and 26% respectively. New process technology is
rarely implemented as cleaner production measure, with only 5%. 60 Equipment

2.3.6 Barriers and constraints of cleaner production Although cleaner production can bring many benefits, a number of barriers and
constraints prevent wide spread implementation of cleaner production programs and
measures. These barriers and constraints fall into four categories: financial, attitudinal,
institutions and policy, and technological constraints (Visvanathan and Kumar 1999;
Frijns 2000).
Many practices of cleaner production in the world show that one of the important
constraints is lack of finance (Visvanathan and Kumar 1999; Frijns 2001). In the various
case studies and practices cleaner production unavailability of capital to invest in new
equipment or systems often becomes a significant obstacle to cleaner production
implementation. Because options related to new technology processes often require
large investments, these are particularly vulnerable to financial constraints. Only large
companies can afford to invest sufficient funds for such options; small and medium-
sized enterprises suffer most from financial constraints. The attitude of the factory manager towards cleaner production is a fundamental factor
in the adoption of cleaner production. The perception of leaders is a prerequisite for a
successful cleaner production project; they too often resist change and innovation. And
many managers still live by the misconception that prevention measures only cost
money. In addition, the attitudes of employees have significant influence on success as
well as maintenance of a cleaner production program. 61 Generally, in developing countries there is often a lack of institutional framework and
supportive policies to effectively promote the application of cleaner technology in
production. Sometimes economic supporting tools exist (such as financial funds, low
interest rates, tax reduction) but these are insufficient to encourage enterprises to
massively apply cleaner production. In addition, standards and regulations on
environmental performance promote rather the implementation of end-of-pipe
technologies than cleaner production approaches.
Cleaner production is a process that takes time as it involves technological changes.
Technical constraints impede the ability of a company to develop, and implement
cleaner production programs. These include absence of readily available cleaner
production technologies that can be adopted directly, and the lack of expertise on
cleaner production within the company. In Vietnam
As reported by Nhan (2006), although a number of demonstration projects have been
implemented with financial support from international organizations (such as UNEP,
UNDP, UNIDO), the implementation of cleaner production is still limited in Vietnam.
This is expressed in the number of enterprises that implemented cleaner production.
Until 2007, seven years after the cleaner production declaration, only 200 enterprises
have implemented a cleaner production program in Vietnam. In Vietnam, the following
barriers for cleaner production implementation can be noticed. Many cleaner production projects in Vietnam are not successful, because these projects
are initiated by the Vietnam Cleaner Production Center (VNCPC) or the Ministry of
Industry and Trade and supported with initial finances and consultants from
international organizations or the government. The reason that companies join such
demonstration projects is that they see these projects as a way to improve environmental
protection without spending money. But once the (financial) support stops these
companies are no longer interested. In addition, a weak link with and poor coordination
between policies results in poor application of cleaner production and more
environmental friendly technology. In its evaluation of the implementation of the
National Plan on the Environment and Sustainable Development for the period 1991-
2000, the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment MoSTE stated that
“existing economic policies are not actually environmental friendly and technological
policies are not really linked with environmental protection and the enforcement”.
While other documents like the strategy on environmental protection 2010 and national
orientations towards 2020 (Khai 2003) or the Vietnam Agenda 21 of Government
(Dung 2004) presented pollution prevention and cleaner production as key solutions for
environmental protection, once coming to specific programs and measures, the role of
cleaner production is often much less prominent. In addition, the Law on Environmental
Protection is still focused on waste treatment rather than on waste minimization. In the
recent decree of the Government No 23/2005/CT-TTg, dated 21 June 2005, on
strengthening hazardous waste management, the principle of hazardous waste
minimization was mentioned only once. With the prevalence of command-and-control
environmental policy at present and a lack of state capacity in enforcement of
environmental laws, it is not encouraging for companies to implement cleaner
production. 62 While existing policies on cleaner production remain insufficient, cleaner production is
not yet a legal requirement for new industrial projects and investments. For example,
application of cleaner production is voluntary and not part of compulsory regulation,
such as environmental impact assessment, monitoring of environmental quality, or the
building of wastewater treatment plants. A company that receives an ISO certification
can enter new exports markets (certainly for textile and garment). For the domestic
market, a company with the certification of “high quality Vietnamese goods’’ will also
attract more customers. But the application of cleaner production is not followed by
larger domestic markets, or a wider penetration in the world market. Lack of finances is also an important constraint for cleaner production in Vietnam. In
order to replace existing technologies and machines large amounts of money are
required, which textile companies often can not afford. The existing economic support
in Vietnam (via financial funds, low interest rates, tax reduction and exemption) has
failed up till now to encourage large numbers of enterprises to apply clean and
environmental friendly technology. For example, the environmental protection funds,
with each a total capital of between ten billion VND and hundred billion VND, can not
afford financial support of new process technologies. Besides, administrative
procedures to access financial support are complicated and cumbersome (Khoa 2006). Attitudes of factory managers strongly resist change and innovation in industrial
processes and practices. Distrust and disinterest in alternative processes are widespread
and managers of small and medium-sized enterprises – and even of large enterprises –
show reluctance to change. Managers usually hesitate to seek outside assistance also out
of commercial confidentiality, especially in the textile industry. Results of interviews
with fifty textile company managers in March 2007 show that they did not receive any
relevant information from cleaner production programs; most of them never heard of the
concept of cleaner production or they still thought prevention measures only cost money
(An 2007). In addition, the low education level of employees – a characteristic of
Vietnam’s textile and garment industry – has a significant negative influence on success
as well as maintenance of cleaner production programs at the enterprise level.
2.4 Industrial ecology 2.4.1 Variations of the concept of industrial ecology The ideas that have shaped industrial ecology began to emerge 40 years ago, and it has
been strongly developed in the recent decade. There are many definitions of industrial
ecology. Erkman (1997) and Frosch and Gallopoulous (1989) define industrial ecology
as industrial components that link together to minimize the impact of the industrial
system on the environment, by optimizing the material and energy flows going through
the industrial system. Industrial ecology is about how to make the industrial system
compatible with the way natural ecosystems function. According to the definition of
industrial ecology from Graedel and Allenby (2003), industrial ecology is the way in
which humanity can deliberately and rationally approach and maintain sustainability.
The concept requires that an industrial system environmentally optimizes the total
material cycle from virgin material, to finished material, to component, to product, to
obsolete product, and to ultimate disposal. Factors to be optimized include resources, 63 energy and capital. As mentioned by Van Koppen and Mol (2002) industrial ecology is
regarded as a broad concept, encompassing industrial ecosystems as well as approaches
that pursue environmental improvement along the lines of life cycle management,
design for environment, and service economy. 2.4.2 Basic principles of industrial ecology Regarding Yang and Lay (2004), there are three basic elements in industrial ecology.
First, energy requirements should be minimized, as should waste generation and the
consumption of scarce resource. Second, industrial wastes and discarded products
should be used as input to industrial – or other production – processes, in a way
analogous to the cycles of nutrients by various organisms in ecological food webs. Last,
the system should be diverse and resilient in order to absorb and recover from
unexpected shocks.  In most instances, either entirely new industries or significant
modifications of existing industries are developed. Within the broad framework of
industrial ecology three concepts are often mentioned and used: industrial metabolism,
industrial symbiosis, and industrial ecosystem. The industrial metabolism refers to the entire material and energy flows going through
an industrial system. Industrial metabolism is studied through essentially analytical and
descriptive approaches (based on the material-balance principle), and aims at
understanding the circulation of material and energy flows linked to human activities
(Erkman 1997). Manhan (1999) also shows that industrial metabolism can be examined
at factory, industry, and global level. In a similar way, Van Koppen and Mol (2002)
define the concept of industrial metabolism as the analysis of material flows in systems
of production and consumption. Industrial symbiosis engages traditionally separate industries in a collective approach,
involving systems of physical exchanges of materials, energy, water and/or by-product
for mutual advantage. The key to industrial symbiosis is collaboration and the
synergistic possibility offered by geographic proximity (Chertow et al. 2004). Industrial
symbiosis is part of industrial ecology. The concept resembles symbiosis in nature, a
biological term referring to “a close sustained living together of two species or kinds of
organism (Encyclopaedia Britannica 1992). An industrial ecosystem is a synthetic analogue of a natural ecosystem, with connection
through the flow of materials and energy between the various firms/production units
(Sagar and Frosch 1997). In an industrial ecosystem, the interdependency among firms
is based primarily on the use of waste materials and waste energy from some industries
and turns that into raw materials for others. To mature as an industrial ecosystem, it
must go beyond the use of waste materials and energy, explicitly addressing other
considerations, including design and construction. Constructing industrial ecosystems is
seen as a concrete strategy for developing closed loop systems locally, in industrial
parks or regions (Ernest and Evans 1995). Van Koppen and Mol (2002) mentioned that
industrial ecosystems are characterized as communities of companies and other
organizations that collaborate to achieve enhanced environmental and economic
performance or greater eco-efficiency. Models for operational industrial ecology
suggest simple design principles, for example: 64 - Closing material loops, avoiding upsets to the metabolism of the natural system
(toxics
elimination
and
pollution
prevention),
dematerialization,
and
thermodynamically efficient energy utilization. (Tibbs and Hardin 1992; Lowe
1994; Ehrenfeld 1995);
- Moving from linear through-put to closed loop material and energy use (Ehrenfeld
and Gertler 1997);
- Cascading energy use and the use of industrial by-products as feedstock
(Ehrenfeld and Gertler 1997). 2.4.3 Application of industrial ecology The idea of industrial ecology has been applied in case studies in different countries in
the world. Each of them brings experiential lessons to improve industrial ecology in the
future. Some industrial ecology projects have been implemented successfully, of which
the Kalundborg industrial park in Denmark, and the industrial ecosystem project in the
Rotterdam harbor area, the Netherlands, are among the early success stories (Gertler and
Ehrenfeld 1996). Kalundborg involves the exchange of waste, by-products, and energy
among firms situated closely together, among which a power station, oil refinery,
pharmaceuticals & enzymes, plasterboard firms, and several energy users within the
municipality. The Kalundborg industrial ecology project brings more efficient use of
material, energy, resource and elimination of waste, and increased both economic and
environmental benefits. It has become a pioneer to pushing industrial ecology in
practice. Another often cited example is the industrial ecosystem project (INES) in the
Rotterdam harbor area, the Netherlands. In this industrial area many refineries and
chemical firms are located, which reuse waste streams and by-products and exchange
energy from each other. According to Baas (1998) the INES project showed the efficiencies to reduce the use of
energy, water and bio sludge significantly. From the INES projects, the following
experiences are drawn: (1) pollution prevention and cleaner production are important
elements of industries ecology; (2) the diversity in composition of industrial ecology is
importance; (3) an informal network among participants joining the project contributes
to the success of the project. Heeres et al.(2004) compared six Eco-industrial park development projects, three
located in the Netherlands and three in the United States. The Dutch EIP projects
proved more successful than their US counterpart. The experiences drawn from these
projects are that heavy government involvement are no impulse to interest companies
for EIPs; on other hand the successfulness of such projects usually largely depends on
spontaneous offers of companies. These projects do show that planed EIP development
is a long term process. The central lesson from these and other case studies (such as
EIPs in Germany, and in the state of Queensland, Australia) is that one needs to
consider carefully the system boundaries and the role of local and regional public
authorities (Baas and Boons 2004; Korhonen 2004; Roberts 2004; Sterr and Ott 2004;
Von Malmborg 2004). The case studies and international experiments on industrial ecology extend to the Asian
region. The paper of Chiu and Young (2004) informs us of examples of industrial 65 ecology in Asian developing countries. They present a strong argument that Asian
developing countries could adopt industrial ecology as a long term strategy to combine
national development, economic growth, and sustainable development. The case of
Singapore’s Jurong Island comprises food and beverage outlets, convenience stores, a
medical clinic, and recreational enterprises (Yang and Lay 2004). In Guangxi Guangxi
city, China, the industrial symbiosis consist of interlinked production of sugar, alcohol,
cement, compound fertilizer, and paper and includes recycling and reuse. For this case,
Lowe et al. (2007) show that application of actor network analysis (customer, supplier,
communities, research and training institutes, and government) contributes to putting
industrial ecology successfully to work. In Vietnam, industrial ecology is still a new concept. This concept has been introduced
to Vietnam by Phuong (2002), Dieu (2003), Khoa (2006) and Nhat (2007). Through a
number of case-study analyses of industrial ecology, it is suggested that Vietnam could
adopt industrial ecology to combine environmental improvement and economic
development of enterprises and the many industrial zones and parks. But Nhat (2007)
also uses the concepts for different small and medium-scale argo-industries in the
tanning, slaughter and seafood processing sector. An early successful application of the
industrial ecology concept for a Vietnamese industrial park was developed by Dieu and
colleagues (2003; 2005). The environmental friendly industrial park project was carried
out at Bien Hoa, Dong Nai Province. Exchange of by-products among companies inside
and outside the park was analyzed and the necessary networks were identified. 2.5 Actor networks As noted above most industrial ecology studies and analyses, and also many of the
cleaner production and end-of-pipe studies, are preoccupied with substance flows and
technological innovations in industrial systems. Usually the actors and institutions that
have to implement environmental innovation receive marginal attention. By the same
token, most of these studies see major barriers for implementation related to these actors
and institutions. It is against this background that network studies have been introduced
in cleaner production and industrial ecology studies. Network models have the advantage of combining both the structural properties of
institutions and the interactions between actors constructing a network. Networks can be
characterized as social systems in which actors engage in more or less permanent,
institutionalized interactions. There appear several analytical network models in
literature, also with respect to environment-informed transformations in economic
sectors. Most of them are rather constructed on an ad hoc basis, following directly from
one or a limited number of empirical studies. A triad-network model (Mol 1995) is a
more systematic way of analyzing actors and institutions around industrial systems
under environmental reform. While earlier studies did concentrate on the role of
governments and policy networks, or the contribution of entrepreneurs and value chains,
this triad network model brings together three interdependent networks in industrial
innovations: a policy network, an economic/industrial network, and a societal network.
The triad network model enables us to systematically analyze the actual and potential
contribution of different actors and their related institutions to environmental reforms in
industries and industrial systems. 66 The triad-network model is a conceptual model for analyzing the extent to which an
ecological ‘perspective’ penetrates and transforms the social practices predominately
governed by three basic perspectives in modern society: political, economic and
societal. The triad-network model combines these three analytical perspectives with
three networks around given social practices: an economic, a policy and a societal
network. Each of the three interdependent networks constitutes thus a combination of a
specific analytical perspective, distinctive institutional arrangements and a restricted
number of interacting (collective) actors, which are considered to be most important
regarding that perspective. Applied for industrial transformation and industrial ecology,
the following networks are distinguished: Within policy networks, interactions and institutional arrangements between state
organizations and industry are primarily governed by political-administrative rules and
resources. Other interactions and institutional arrangements are also inspired by and can
be analyzed from this perspective, although they will then prove to be more peripheral.
Policy network studies analyze the interdependencies between these actors, the ‘rules of
the game’ which put these policy networks to work, the resources dependencies
(regarding power, money, knowledge, information etc.) between the various actors and
agents dominant in these policy networks, the common or diverging world view along
which communication and joint strategies are developed or not, etc. There exists a
considerable amount of literature (e.g. in neo-corporatism and policy community
studies) that provides evidence of the usefulness of such analyses of the transformations
and continuities in these interdependent network actors (Grant et al. 1988; Marsh and
Rhodes 1992; Smith 1993; Mol 1995). Economic networks basically focus on economic interactions via economic rules and
resources between economic agents in and around the industrial park, chain or sector
that form the object and unit of analysis. Although the intellectual background of
economic network analyses are mainly to be found in industrial organization theory,
institutional economics and organizational sociology, the basic concepts differ only
partially from those in policy network analyses. Economic network studies analyze the
relationships between the firms, the network structures in terms of power and resource
dependencies, and the economic processes of continuity and transformation. They look
at (i) the vertical interactions from raw material producer up until the final consumer
and beyond, (ii) the horizontal relations between competitors and on the level of the
industrial branch association providing some collective interest representation, and (iii)
regional relations and interactions in restricted geographical areas. The relations with
conventional industrial ecology analyses of the material flows in geographical areas or
production-consumption chains (e.g. LCA) are evident, but in the network studies the
emphasis is rather on the non-material dimensions of the park/chain/network (economic
relations, power, information monopoly and exchange, knowledge, control, ownership,
etc.). Håkansson (1988), Martinelli (1991) and Grabher (1993) are relevant volumes that
provide valuable conceptual tools for analyzing these economic networks in detail. Thirdly and finally, societal networks aim at identifying relations between an industry, a
chain, an industrial sector or an industrial park the one hand, and civil society
organizations and arrangements associated with what is usually called ‘the life world’ 67 on the other. It is the rich tradition of (new) social movement research that provides the
conceptual tools to analyze the interaction patterns, and their continuity and
transformation, between on the one hand environmental and consumer organizations
and on the other industrial firms. In general, interactions between the NGOs and the
industry in question take place in three dimensions:  direct, indirect, and via state
agencies. In Vietnam real independent environmental NGOs as we know them in
Europe or the U.S. do not exist. So, at present strong NGO pressure, which forces
significant changes in industrial production, can not be expected. But more diffuse civil
society impact on environmental reform might be present, via the media or via
unorganized citizens. 2.6 Research methodology 2.6.1 Research strategy and case study selection
In order to achieve the objectives stated in Chapter 1, the research strategy in this
research focuses especially on practical experiments and case studies. The practical
experiments are especially used for acquiring additional technological knowledge on
waste treatment options, as building blocks for constructing our textile industry model.
The most important characteristics of a case study approach are to study in depth a
relatively small number of research units, rather than an overall research on multiple
cases. This was especially used to operationalize and test an industrial ecology model
for the textile industry. In time, the research strategy encompasses three major components: (1) development of
theoretical frameworks and models (end-of-pipe, cleaner production, industrial ecology,
waste exchange networks, actor networks) that can be interpreted as building blocks to
be combined in reducing the textile’s environmental impacts; (2) the collection,
analysis, and assessment of production processes, characteristics of waste streams,
technological options, organizational models for textile industry. Laboratory and field
experiments, literature research, assessments of environmental performances and
economic costs provide us with practical information on the contribution of theoretical
models for the current textile industry in Vietnam. (3) Constructing optimal models of
environmental performance of two textile case studies in contemporary Vietnam, in
which end-of-pipe, cleaner production and industrial ecology ideas are combined into an
optimal model for a stand alone textile company and a textile industrial park. At present, there are more than two thousands textile companies in Vietnam, of which
more than 50 companies are large ones. Although in number the large companies are
small (2.5% of all textile plants), they significantly affect the environment by
discharging high concentrations and significant volumes of wastewater, air pollution
and solid waste. In addition, large textile enterprises involve three stages of processing
(spinning, weaving and finishing) with many products, while medium-sized and small
enterprises often only include one or two stages (dyeing and/or finishing) with few
products. The Thanh Cong Textile and Garment Company is chosen as the first case
study, as it is representative for large textile companies in Hochiminh City. The
willingness of the company to cooperate on this research was a vital argument in
selection. Without company cooperation such a research cannot be carried out. 68 According to development strategy of the Vietnam Textile and Garment Industry Group
(2005) the building of three textile and garment industrial zones is planned. The aim of
these industrial zones is to create an efficient organizational structure for environmental
management, to increase competition on the market, and to minimize pollution. To
analyze the possibilities for environment improvements in a group of textile companies,
research on one industrial zone is carried out. Nhon Trach 2 industrial zone in Dong Nai
is selected as the second case study. In this industrial zone a significant number of
textile companies are located, making it a potential interesting case for designing an
industrial system.
2.6.2 Methods of data collection and analysis
Basic information on the contribution of end-of-pipe treatment processes, cleaner
production and waste exchange possibilities have been collected through analysis of
secondary data and via laboratory and pilot scale experiments. These latter methods
were directed to specific treatment technologies. Laboratory and pilot scale experiments
on the treatment of real textile wastewater are used to gain additional knowledge on the
potential contribution of different approaches to reduce the environmental pollution of
textile production processes. For building the model around the two case studies primary and secondary data were
collected and analyzed. First primary data on a large number of textile industries in
Vietnam were collected, such as on manufacturing processes, environmental pollution
situation, and environmental performance through interviews and on-site measurement
and investigation (by survey, sampling and analysis of air pollution, wastewater, solid
waste of textile enterprises). The investigated enterprises were mostly located in Le
Minh Xuan industrial zone, district 6, 11, Tan Binh, and Tan Phu in Hochiminh city,
Nhon Trach 2 industrial zone in Dong Nai. After visiting several enterprises, more
detailed primary data were collected of the selected enterprise and industrial zone
through sampling, measurement and analysis of material flows of the selected
enterprises. This enabled us to construct a mass balance and calculate the exchange of
energy and material flows between enterprises inside and outside the industrial ecology
model. Interviews were another source of primary data. Personal in-depth interviews (face to
face) with managers and personnel of the selected companies were made. Information
related to manufacturing, compliance with laws on environmental protection, and
company development strategies came from interviews with actors in the networks
surrounding the case studies. In order to further analyze the role of different actors in
the policy, economic and social networks, experts of the Vietnam Textile and Garment
group (VINATEX), the Vietnam Environment Administration (VEA), MONRE,
DONRE of Dong Nai and Hochiminh city, authorities of the industrial zones of Dong
Nai and Hochiminh city (Hepza) have been interviewed. In addition, in-depth
interviews and discussions with experts and consultants at institutes, universities, and
research centers such as the Polytechnic University in Ha Noi, Van Lang University in
Hochiminh city, the Center for Environmental Technology and Management 69 (CENTEMA),  and the Vietnam Cleaner Production Center (VNCPC) have been carried
out for generating ideas and checking options. Secondary data were collected for different phases of this research from various
sources, among which: annual statistics from the General Department of Statistics; the
annual; reports of VINATEX and reports of the Vietnam Textile and Apparel
Association (VITAS); monitoring data on environmental quality from several
environmental authorities; annual monitoring reports on environmental quality from the
selected companies and industry; national and international scientific literature. 70 Chapter 3 Physical/ chemical processes: experimental research 72 3.1 Introduction
The textile industry causes serious pollution for the environment due to the large
quantity and high concentration of pollutants in wastewater, when discharged untreated.
The pollution originates from the textile enterprise’s use of various dyestuffs and
auxiliary chemicals in the production process, which end-up in significant quantities in
the wastewater. The remaining dyes in the textile industry effluent usually have a high
color intensity and organic matter concentration. Almost all dyes are difficult to degrade
and decolorize due to their complex structure and synthetic origin. The choice of a
treatment method for textile wastewater will depend on the used class of dyestuff and of
the specific discharge standards. The color is considered as one of the key parameters in
the treatment of textile wastewater. The removal of color from a solution can occur according to four main mechanisms.
Firstly some compounds undergo color change and even become colorless at certain pH
ranges. Secondly decolorization can occur when colored compounds are adsorbed in
flocs produced by a coagulation process. Thirdly the chromophore/auxochrome bond is
broken without the actual break-up of the major fragment of the original dye molecule.
Finally, the addition of a bleaching agent could decolorize wastewater. However, if a
bleaching agent is used part of the color disappearance might not be due to full
degradation of dyestuffs. Besides, their by-products could be more toxic than the
original compound. In order to understand more clearly the color removing mechanisms, the color removal
processes for textile wastewater will be studied in this chapter. A general introduction is
given in section 3.1. The change of color at various pHs is discussed in section 3.2.
Section 3.3 describes the removal of color by means of physical/chemical treatment
processes (coagulation processes). Section 3.4 presents the study on the removal of
color by chemical treatment processes (advanced oxidation processes). Finally, in
section 3.5 some conclusions are presented. 3.2 Change of color by pH adjustment 3.2.1 Introduction The pH is one of the important factors that affect the efficiency of treating wastewater
by coagulation or advanced oxidation processes, especially with regard to color removal
from textile wastewater. Some compounds undergo color change and even become
colorless at a certain pH range. For instance a color indicator substance such as
phenolphthalein is colorless at pH 4.5 and becomes pink at pH 8.3. If wastewater pH
adjustment alone can cause decolorization is still not fully known. Therefore the effect
of pH on color removal in textile wastewater was studied for four types of wastewater:
(1) disperse & reactive dyes, (2) vat dyes, (3) disperse & acid dyes and (4) a mixture of
several wastewater streams from other steps of dyeing and finishing processes (= mixed
wastewater). The following studies are presented and discussed: -
Assessing the change of color for the four wastewater streams at pH 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7 and 10, using sulphuric acid to adjust the pH; 73 -
Assessing the effects of different types of acids (HCl and H2SO4) on the color
change.
3.2.2 Materials and methods
Apparatus
-
pH meter: the pH was determined with a pH meter model MP220, manufactured
by Mettler Toledo, Switzerland. The pH range is from 0 to 14 ( 0.01).
-
Magnetic stirrer with heating facility: made by WWR, USA, model 375. The maximum
heating temperature was 550C, the maximum stirring speed was 2,000 rpm with a
magnetic stir bar. -
The spectrophotometer was a GENESYS*20 made by Hach, USA with a
wavelength range of 390 to 900nm. -
Low speed centrifuge:  model FUHUA 80-2, made in China. The maximum
rotational speed was 4,000rpm with a relative centrifugal force of 1,795g. The
low speed centrifuge has the following specifications: 
Volume of centrifugal tube : 10 ml

Number of  tubes : 12 tubes
 Diameter of centrifugal tube : 2 cm Chemicals Two types of acids were applied to assess the effect of the different acid types on the
color removal efficiency of the four wastewater streams (disperse & reactive dyes, vat
dyes, disperse & acid dyes, and mixed wastewater). -
HCl  5%;
-
H2SO4 10%. The acid solutions of 5-10 % were prepared by diluting concentrated acid (HCl 35% and
H2SO4 98%) with demineralized water. The used H2SO4 and HCl were of pure grade
from Merck. Analytical methods Measurement of color was performed according to the single-wavelength method
(APHA 1995). Color intensity is determined by comparison of the sample with a known
platinum-cobalt solution as a standard. In all experiments the color intensity was
measured with a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 455nm. The color intensity is
expressed as Pt-Co. The color intensity was also determined at three further
wavelengths: 436 nm (yellow), 525 nm (red) and 620 nm (blue) and was then expressed
as absorption. If the color exceeded 500 Pt-Co units, the sample was diluted until the color intensity
was within the linear region of the absorption-concentration curve. The pH was determined by a pH meter. 74 Procedure for pH variation tests The pH variation experiments were performed in 250 ml beakers using samples of 150
ml of wastewater. The sample was mixed with a magnetic stirrer during pH adjustments.
Acid solution was added to the sample with a burette. At the end of experiment the
sample was left to settle for 30 minutes after which the supernatant was collected for
determination of the color intensity and turbidity. In this study the influence of centrifuging the wastewater samples, prior to addition of
acid solutions, was also examined to compare the influence of suspended solids on color
removal by changing the pH. The applied centrifuge speed was 3,000 rpm for 5
minutes. Type of wastewaters Wastewaters used for the experiments were provided by the 28 Company-Agtex in
Vietnam. The main products of this company are cotton, blended cotton & polyester
(T/C), synthetic fabrics, and blended wool. With a complete production system ranging
from yarn twisting, weaving, dyeing and finishing, sewing to finished products, the
company has a full set of modern technology and equipment. The dyeing process is
applied according to the cold pad batch method and exhaust batch method (dyeing
batch) at high pressure. From the cold pad batch process with main textile products G.TC.219 fabric (35%
cotton and 65% polyester), wastewater containing disperse & reactive dyes and with
P.TC. 277 fabric (25% cotton and 75% polyester), wastewater containing vat dyes were
used for investigation. For the dyeing batch process with G.TW.538 L5 fabric (blended wool), disperse & acid
dye wastewater samples were used to perform experiments. Mixed sample is wastewater containing a mixture of several wastewater streams from
other steps in the dyeing and finishing process, which was collected at the equalization
tank. The wastewater samples were stored at 40C and left to warm to room temperature (25-
280C) before experiments. A flow scheme of the cold pad batch and the dyeing batch processes together with
collection points of the wastewater samples is given in section 5.5.2 of chapter 5. Characteristics and structure of some dyestuffs In order to understand the mechanism of the chemical reactions in decolorization of
dyestuffs, the general characteristics of vat, disperse, reactive and acid dyestuffs used in
the manufacturing processes of the 28 Company-Agtex are described in more detail. 75 Vat Dyes
Vat dyes are usually very insoluble in water and most organic solvents. The vat dyes
need to be introduced in a soluble form to the fabric to impregnate the fibers. The
fixation of the dye within the fiber is achieved by changing the dye into the insoluble
form. Most commonly, the soluble form of the vat dye is a reduced form, the colorless
leuco form. This leuco form is as an enol soluble in alkaline solution and is applied to
the fabric in this form. Sodium dithionite is currently the favored reducing agent.
Oxidation of leuco form is applied to bring back the dye in its insoluble form. The vat
dyes are primarily used for cotton, rayon, but are also used for acrylics, modacrylic and
nylon. Vat dyes have a high degree of fixation (80-95%) resulting in a small amount of
unfixed dyes ending in the wastewater. Only a few vat dyes contain aromatic organic
halogen (AOX) components and heavy metals in their structure. A low concentration of
vat dyes in wastewater will cause no toxicity to microorganisms, but can be toxic to
some aquatic organisms. The structures of some vat dyes used in the manufacturing
process of  28 Company-Agtex are given in Figure 3.1. Wastewater with these dyes was
used in the experiments. C.I. Vat green 1 C.I. Vat blue 6
Figure 3.1: Structure of two vat dyes Disperse dyes The disperse dyes are substantially insoluble in water. General characteristics of
disperse dyes are small, planar and non-ionic molecules, with attached polar functional
groups like -NO2 and -CN. Their shape makes it easier to slide between the tightly-
packed polymer chains of the fabric, where the polar groups improve the water
solubility by enhancing the dipolar bonding between dye and polymer and affecting the
color of the dye. Disperse dyes are usually applied as a dispersion of finely divided dye
in a soap solution in presence of some solubilizing agent such as phenol, cresol, or
benzoic acid. The process suffers from the fact that usually the absorption of dye into
the fiber is slow and is best carried out at elevated temperature in pressure vessels.
Disperse dyes can be used to dye polyester, nylon, triacetate, and acrylic fibers.
Disperse dyes have a high degree of fixation (90-95%) resulting in a small amount of
unfixed dyes ending in the wastewater. Structures of some disperse dyes which are used
in the production process of the 28 Company-Agtex are presented in Figure 3.2.
Wastewater with these dyes was used in the experiments. 76 Figure 3.2: Structure of three disperse dyes Reactive dyes Reactive dyes are soluble in water and belong to a class of highly colored organic
substances. Reactive groups in reactive dyes react chemically to form covalent bonds
with OH, NH2 or SH groups in fibers. The dye structure is often a heterocyclic aromatic
ring with most commonly a vinyl sulphone reactive group. Reactive dyes are applied
mostly to cellulose fibers, cotton, rayon, and linen. Some are appropriate for use on
wool. In the dyeing process with reactive dyes, hydrolysis of reactive groups is an
undesired side reaction that lowers the degree of fixation. The fixation degree of
reactive dyes is 60-70%. Figure 3.3 gives the structure of some reactive dyes which are
used in the production process of the 28 Company-Agtex. Wastewater with these dyes
was also used in the experiments. C.I. Reactive Yellow 14 C.I. Reactive yellow C-2RR Figure 3.3: Structure of some reactive dyes Acid dyes Most acid dyes are azo dyes, antharaquinone or triarylmethane containing compounds.
Acid dyes are water soluble anionic dyes. When acid dyes are applied in acid solutions
they react chemically with alkaline groups (NH3) in the fabric’s fiber structure and form
ionic bonds. Because wool has both acid and alkaline groups in its structure, acid dyes
can be used quite successfully on wool. These dyes are also utilized for dyeing nylon
and to a lesser extent for acrylics, some modified polyesters, polypropylene, and
spandex. The acid dyes are used in an acid medium containing acetate or sulphuric acid
to set the color. Acid dyes cannot be used on cellulose fiber because these are
susceptible to damage from the acid. The acid dyes are non-caustic, in many cases non-
C.I Disperse Yellow 211

two factors of concern for the environment are: the amount of acid solution and the
unfixed dyes that will end-up in the wastewater at the end of process. Figure 3.4 give
the structure of some acid dyes which are used in the production process of the 28
Company-Agtex. Wastewater with these dyes was also used in the experiments. C.I. Acid Red 249 C.I. Acid red 1 Figure 3.4: Structure of two acid dyes Composition of wastewater streams Table 3.1 presents the composition of the textile wastewater streams of two processes:
the cold pad batch and dyeing batch. The table shows that concentration of pollutants in
the wastewater from the dyeing batch is higher than in the wastewater of the cold pad
batch process. For example, the color of the wastewater from the dyeing batch is more
than 2 to 3 times intensive and the COD 10 to 15 times higher in comparison with
effluent of the cold pad batch. In addition, two parameters also have to be considered
for treating textile wastewater: temperature and pH. The temperature of the wastewater
varies between 45 to 600C and the pH of the wastewater is very high or low depending
on types of used dyestuffs. A low pH (pH 5) of the wastewater is due to acid conditions
of the dyeing batch process with acid dyes, while a high pH (pH 11) is due to the
alkaline medium used in dyeing with disperse & reactive dyes, and the vat dye in the
cold pad batch. The mixed wastewater is constituted by several wastewater streams
from other steps in the dyeing and finishing processes. As a result the COD and color of
the mixed wastewater is higher compared to cold pad batch wastewater and is lower
compared to the wastewater of the dyeing batch process. Table 3.1: Composition of the textile wastewater streams of the 28 Company-Agtex Parameters

processes containing disperse & reactive dyes, vat dyes, disperse & acid dyes, and
mixed wastewater was investigated. Besides the pH variation the type of acid was tested
for best color removal. Disperse and reactive dyes (red wastewater) Using H2SO4 10% to adjust pH Disperse and reactive dyes wastewater has a high pH of 8.4. For centrifuged and non
centrifuged wastewater samples the pH was adjusted from 8.4 to 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1,
corresponding to used volumes of acid of 0.8, 2.6, 2.9, 3.5, 15.2 and 120 ml/L
respectively. Figure 3.6 shows the results of color change as a function of pH
adjustments for centrifuged and non-centrifuged samples. The non-centrifuged samples
show a maximum color removal efficiency of 31% at a pH value of 5; the color reduced
from 1,140 Pt-Co to 780 Pt-Co. Note that color reduction at lower pH’s was also caused
by dilution of the sample with the acid solution. Centrifugation of samples resulted in a significant color reduction without pH decrease,
the color reduced from 1,140 to 820 Pt-Co corresponding to a removal efficiency of
28%. Results of pH change on the centrifuged samples were similar to the non-
centrifuged ones. At pH 1 the color removal efficiency achieved a maximum of 44%.
However, again a large volume of acid solution was added to the sample (120 ml acid
solution per liter sample, a dilution of 12%) to adjust the pH to 1. The results in general show that a slight reduction in color was found with decrease of
the pH. The shape of the curves of both experiments was similar as can be seen in
Figure 3.5. However, the maximum efficiency in color reduction of the centrifuged
samples was higher than for the non-centrifuged ones. The higher color intensity of the
non-centrifuged samples could be caused by the turbidity, whereas with centrifuged
samples the effect of turbidity was prevented. 80 Disperse & reactive dyes wastewater

7.2, 30, and 200 ml HCl/L to adjust the pH to 6, 4, 2, and 1 for centrifuged and non-
centrifuged samples. Figure 3.6 shows that centrifuged and non-centrifuged samples
gave the same results. The color slightly reduced at lower values of pH. The color
removal efficiency was in the range of 14-27% for centrifuged samples, and 14-40% for
non-centrifuged samples. Maximum efficiency was achieved at a pH value of 1.
However, at that pH a large volume of acid was added to the samples (200 ml acid 5%
for a liter of sample, a dilution of 20%). The results show the same tendency as in case
of the use of H2SO4 to decrease pH. Figure 3.6: Effect of pH on color intensity of disperse & reactive dyes wastewater.
HCl was used to decrease the pH of wastewater
Figure 3.7 presents a comparison between the effects of different acids on the color
intensity. In brief, the influence of the type of acid on change of color was not
significant in the case of non-centrifuged samples. In the case of centrifuged samples it
is observed that for disperse & reactive dyes wastewater a higher color removal
efficiency is obtained with the use of H2SO4. 81 Non-centrifugated sample

removal efficiency between the use of H2SO4 and HCl acid. Therefore, the experiments
with vat dyes wastewater samples were only performed with H2SO4. Similar to the disperse & reactive dyes, dyeing with vat dye in alkaline medium results
in a wastewater with a high pH (10.3). The pH was adjusted to 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, and 1 using
the addition of acid volumes of 0.16, 0.18, 0.30, 0.34, 2 and 8 ml/L of sample
respectively. As can be seen in Figure 3.8 the color did not change much with change in
pH. The maximum removal efficiency achieved was only 9%. Figure 3.8: Effect of pH on color intensity of vat dyes wastewater. H2SO4 was used

Disperse and acid dyes (green wastewater) As mentioned above, the dyeing batch with disperse and acid dyes are operated at acid
conditions. Therefore the discharged wastewater usually has a low pH (5.7). The
experiments were carried out with centrifuged and non-centrifuged samples. The pH
was adjusted to 4, 3, 2 and 1 using 3.2, 5, 12.8, and 110 ml of H2SO4 (10%) per liter
sample respectively. From Figure 3.9 it can be seen that the change of color intensity
with change in pH of both experiments had a similar shape. There was a little difference
in color change between centrifuged and non-centrifuged samples. The maximum
removal efficiency was only 14-16% at a pH of 1. This was probably due to dilution of
the sample with a large volume of added acid (200 ml per liter sample). These results
also indicate that pH adjustment does not have a significant effect on the color intensity
of disperse & acid dyes wastewater. Figure 3.9: Effect of pH on color intensity of disperse & acid dyes wastewater.
H2SO4 was used to decrease the pH of wastewater Mixed wastewater Similar to the previous experiments, the experiments with mixed wastewater were
carried out with centrifuged and non-centrifuged samples. The pH of the mixed
wastewater was 10.4. The pH was adjusted from 10.4 to 7, 6, 4, 3, 2, and 1 using 0.22,
0.32, 0.42, 0.48, 1.42 and 8 ml H2SO4 (10%) per liter sample respectively. Figure 3.10
shows the effect of pH on the color intensity for both samples. At pH 4 there was no
difference between centrifuged and non-centrifuged samples. For non-centrifuged
samples, at pH 7 the color removal efficiency achieved showed the highest value (33%).
At pH 1 and 2, the color intensity was 1,405 and 1,425 Pt-Co and exceeded the initial
wastewater’s color of 1,390 Pt-Co. Comparable results were also found for centrifuged
samples. At pH values of 1 and 2 formation of flocs in the non-centrifuged wastewaters occurred.
The formed flocs were very small in size. They did not settle and were causing an
increase in turbidity of the sample. At pH of 1 the highest turbidity was found (130
FAU). The sample at pH 1 was filtered or centrifuged after which the color intensity
was measured. Filtration reduced color to 230 Pt-Co (efficiency 83%). The color
intensity of the centrifuged sample was 1,100 Pt-Co (efficiency 20%). These obtained 83 Mixed wastewater

data show that a filtration process (pore size 20 µm) can remove small particles much
more efficient than centrifugation (at 3000 rpm). Figure 3.10: Effect of pH on the color intensity of centrifuged and non-centrifuged
samples of  mixed wastewater
3.2.4 Conclusions In brief, the color intensity of disperse & reactive dyes, vat dyes, and disperse dyes was
hardly affected by change of pH, even when the pH was changed in a wide range from
10 to 1. Only with the disperse & reactive dyes wastewater a significant efficiency in
color removal was achieved (44 %), but this can be partly attributed to the dilution of
wastewater with a large volume of acid solution. The results obtained with centrifuged
and non-centrifuged samples are not very different. The effect of different acids (HCl
and H2SO4) on the change of color was more or less the same. Addition of relatively
large amount of H2SO4 promotes the coagulation/flocculation process resulting in the
formation of small flocs. A centrifugation process can remove these flocs. In this case a
reduction of color intensity of maximal 44% is possible. However, this is not a feasible
option for reducing color intensity because of the large quantity of acids that must be
used. In addition, a large amount of chemicals has to be used to adjust the pH back to a
reasonable level for the next step of the textile wastewater treatment. It was further
found that for mixed wastewater a filtration process (pore size 20 µm) is much more
efficient to remove small particles than a centrifugation process.
3.3 Coagulation/flocculation process 3.3.1 Introduction The chemical coagulation/flocculation process is usually applied as a pre-treatment step
to improve the performance of a biological wastewater treatment, as a polishing or as a
main step for color removal in textile wastewater treatment, and in some cases for
effluent reuse. There is a lot of studies and practice to remove color from the textile wastewater by
chemical coagulation/flocculation (Nicolaou and Hadjivassilis 1992; Altinbas et al. 84 1995; Cooper 1995; Lin and Peng 1996; Marmagn and Coste 1996; Reid 1996; Sarasa
et al. 1998; Vandevivere et al. 1998; Mattioli et al. 2002). However, these studies also
gave different results which are sometimes also contradicting. In order to better
understand the coagulation/flocculation process for a wastewater containing one of the
four investigated dyestuffs mentioned previously, experiments with typical coagulants
such as aluminum sulfate, poly aluminum chloride, and ferrous sulfate were executed to
check the literature and find economically suitable solutions for color removal. The
reasons for selecting these coagulants were: aluminum sulfate is a relatively effective
coagulant in color removal, available and very cheap; ferrous sulfate is cheaper than
ferric sulfate; and poly-aluminum chloride has characteristics of pre-hydrolyzed metal
salts. The objectives of the experiment were:
1. To determine the effect of the types of coagulants on the color removal
efficiency. Three types of coagulants/flocculants were applied: aluminum sulfate
Al2(SO4)3.18H2O poly-aluminum chloride (PAC), and ferrous sulfate
FeSO4.7H2O. 2. Using the above mentioned types of coagulants to assess the removal of color
for four different wastewater streams (disperse & reactive dye, vat dye, disperse
& acid dye, and mixed wastewater) by a coagulation/flocculation process in
dependence of pH and amount of coagulant.
3. To determine the optimal pH. The pH was varied from 4 to 8 when using
Al2(SO4)3.18H2O; from 6 to 9 when using PAC and from 9 to 11 when using
FeSO4.7H2O at a constant dosage of coagulants for each wastewater type:
aluminum sulfate: 900 mg/L, ferrous sulfate: 1,000 mg/L and poly-aluminum
chloride: 900 mg/L. The pH was adjusted with H2SO4 or NaOH solutions.
4. To determine the optimal dosage of coagulant. The dosage of coagulant was
varied from 400 to 1,200 mg/L for Al2(SO4 )3.18H2O and PAC, and from 400 to
1,800 mg/L for Fe2SO4.7H2O. The experiments in which the effect of type and
amount of coagulant were executed at optimal pH which was determined from
pH optimization experiments.
5. Using the above mentioned coagulants/flocculants to determine the effect of
temperature on the coagulation/flocculation process. The textile wastewater
usually has a high temperature, therefore cooling of the wastewater is the first
step in the textile wastewater treatment process. The effect of temperature was
measured at three levels: 30, 40 and 500C.
3.3.2 Materials and methods
Apparatus
Jar test equipment, model JLT6 (Velp Scientifiza, the Netherlands), was used in the
experiments to determine optimal pH and to determine the optimal dosage of coagulant.
The jar test apparatus comprises of 6 beakers for samples, stirred simultaneously by 6
mixers. The type of mixer was a flat blade propeller. The rotation speed could be varied
from 10 to 300 rpm. The jar test set-up is presented in Figure 3.11. 85 The spectrophotometer was a GENESYS*20 made by Hach, USA with a wavelength
range of 390 to 900nm. The pH meter was model MP220, manufactured by Mettler
Toledo, Switzerland. The conductivity meter was model Sension 5 manufactured by
Hach, USA. Figure 3.11: The JLT6 Jar test set-up
Chemicals
The coagulant/flocculation experiments were performed with three selected coagulants.
The coagulation solutions were prepared by dissolving 5-10 % powder of the three
coagulants in water. The pH adjustments were made by the addition of H2SO4 or NaOH
(5-10%). The H2SO4 or NaOH solutions were prepared from concentrated H2SO4 (95-
98%) or NaOH (98%) pellets and demineralized water to obtain the desired 5-10%
concentration. All coagulants used in the coagulation experiments were commercial
available chemicals, and the H2SO4 and NaOH were of pure grade. Analytical methods
COD, BOD5, and alkalinity were determined according to Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Wastewater (APHA 1995):
-
COD: closed reflux, titrimetric method.
-
BOD: 5-day BOD test (at 200C).
-
Alkalinity: titration method with standard acid solution.
-
Color was measured with a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 455 nm, and
was expressed in Pt-Co. Turbidity was measured by a spectrophotometer at a
wavelength of 450 nm, and was expressed in FAU (Formazin Attenuation Unit).
-
The pH was determined with a pH meter. This pH meter could measure in the
range between 0 to 14 pH units with accuracy of 0.01.
-
Temperature was measured with a thermometer (0-1000C).
-
The electrical conductivity (EC) and total dissolved solids (TDS) were measured
with a conductivity meter. The conductivity range is 0-1999 µS/cm and total
dissolved solids range is 0-50,000mg/L. 86 Coagulation/flocculation test procedure
The experiments were performed in 6 beakers with a volume of 1,000 ml. Each beaker
contained 500 ml of wastewater. The beakers with wastewater were placed in the jar test
equipment set-up, and the stirring was turned on. The dosages of coagulant and pH
adjustment solutions (H2SO4 or NaOH) were added to the wastewater at the same time.
To determine an optimal pH, the dosage of coagulant was kept constant, and the values
of pH were changed. For determination of an optimal dosage of coagulant, the pH was
kept constant and the dosages of coagulant were changed. Based on literature and field
evaluation it can be concluded that, instantaneous rapid mixing of coagulants is a
critical aspect (Metcalf & Eddy, 2003). Typical mixing times for aluminum sulfate and
ferric sulfate for coagulation of colloidal particles is less 1 minute and sweep floc
precipitation requires 1 to 10 minutes (Metcalf & Eddy, 2003). Therefore, first,
complete mixing of chemicals and wastewater was carried out with a rapid mixing
velocity of 100 rpm for 1 min. Then the mixing velocity was decreased to 30 to 40 rpm
(slow mixing) and stirring continued for 30 minutes for flocculation. At the end of the
reaction, flocs were left to settle for 30 minutes before samples of the supernatant were
collected for the determination of pH, color, turbidity, total dissolved solids, and COD.
The total time period of one experiment was about 60 minutes. Type of wastewaters
The wastewater was provided by the 28 Company-Agtex in Vietnam as presented in
section 3.2.2. Four types of wastewater streams were used as described in section 3.2.1.
Wastewater samples were stored at 40C and left at room temperature prior to the start of
the batch experiments. 3.3.3 Results and discussion The coagulation processes of the four wastewater streams containing different dyestuffs
were tested with three types of coagulants. The optimal pH and coagulant dosage for
each wastewater stream is discussed in more detail below. The optimal pH and dosage
of a coagulant were chosen according to the highest efficiency in color removal
achieved for each type of wastewater. Effect of coagulant
Aluminum sulfate Al2(SO4)3.18H2O As mentioned in chapter 2, section 2.2.3 the most appropriate pH conditions for the
coagulation process with aluminum sulfate are in the range of pH 5-8. In this
experiment, the coagulant dosage was kept constant at 500 mg/L for disperse and
reactive dyes wastewater, 900 mg/L for vat dyes and mixed wastewater, and 1,000 mg/L
for disperse and acid dyes wastewater. The pH was varied between 5 and 8. The effect
of the pH on the color removal efficiency for the four wastewater streams is presented
in Figure 3.12. For the vat dyes and the mixed wastewater the optimum pH was 5. For
the disperse and reactive dyes wastewater the optimal pH was 6. For the disperse and
acid dyes wastewater the optimum pH was 7. For the disperse & acid dyes wastewater it
was observed that at pH 5 and 6 the wastewater samples showed a very high turbidity,
resulting in very low color removal. 87 Vat dyes wastewater

At optimal pH the coagulant doses were varied from 200-2,000 mg/L depending on the
concentration of remaining dyestuffs in the wastewater. In Figure 3.13 the effect of the
aluminum sulfate dosage on the color removal efficiency for the four wastewater
streams is presented. A dosage of ≥ 500 mg/L provided a significant color removal
efficiency for disperse and reactive dyes and vat dyes wastewater. At a dosage of 600
mg/L a color removal efficiency of 98% was achieved for vat dyes wastewater. Disperse
and acid dyes wastewater shows a maximum color removal efficiency of 80% with a
coagulant dosage of more than 1,600 mg/L. For mixed wastewater a color removal
efficiency comparable to that of disperse and reactive dyes and vat dyes wastewater was
found (90%, final color 105 Pt-Co). The COD removal efficiencies at the optimum
coagulant dosages for color removal were 81% for mixed and disperse and reactive
wastewater (final COD 230 mg O2/L), and for vat wastewater 84%. For disperse and
acid wastewater only 53% COD removal efficiency was found. Figure 3.12: Effect of pH on the color removal efficiency (E%) for the four

(E%) of the four wastewater streams at optimal pH As reported by Mattioli et al. (2002) one of the disadvantages of a
coagulation/flocculation process is the increase of the ratio of the electric conductivity
(EC) and total dissolved solids (TDS) of the wastewater. This is caused by the addition
of chemicals (coagulant and solution for pH adjustment) to the wastewater to achieve
optimal conditions. Sometimes this will cause an exceeding of the discharge standard of
TDS. In the pH optimizing experiment, the dosage of coagulant added to the sample
was a constant dosage. The pH of the sample was changed from 4 to 8 using H2SO4
(10%). The volume of used H2SO4 was depended on the requirement of pH adjustments
and ranged from 1.8 to 3.3 ml. This study found that after the coagulation process the EC of all of the samples was
slightly reduced in comparison with original sample. For instance, in the case of vat
dyes (blue wastewater) the EC of original sample was 1876 µS/cm. In the optimal pH
experiment the EC reduced to 1852 µS/cm at pH 4, 1768 µS/cm at pH, 1744 µS/cm at
pH 6, 1720 µS/cm at pH 7, and 1704 µS/cm at pH 8. The reduction is very small and
can be explained by the fact that a part of the soluble materials can be removed by
coagulation/flocculation (absorption on flocs). 89 1.E-09

The results of the optimal coagulant dosage experiments were similar to the optimal pH
experiments. In these experiments the amount of coagulant that was added varied from
300-1,200 mg/L. Using 3.0 to 3.6 ml H2SO4 (10%) in order to decrease the pH to an
optimal value of 5 has hardly any effect on the EC of the samples. This proves that the
influence of adding coagulants and the adjustment of pH on the EC is very low.
Therefore, effluents from coagulation/flocculation can meet the Vietnamese standards
for EC. The absence of an increase in EC can be explained from the solubility of
aluminum hydroxide as a function of pH. This relationship is presented in Figure 3.14.
The minimum aluminum solubility is at pH 6. Figure 3.14: The solubility of aluminum hydroxide [Al2(OH)3] as a function of pH The color measurement was carried out by two methods in the coagulation experiments
with mixed wastewater using aluminum sulfate as coagulant. The first method is based
on a comparison of color standards (Pt-Co) at a wavelength of 455 nm (single method).
The second method is based on the light adsorption at different wavelengths: 436 nm
(yellow), 525 nm (red) and 620 nm (blue). In Figure 3.15 the effect of the two methods
on the absorption of mixed wastewater is shown. The absorption of original mixed
wastewater at 455 nm was the lowest in comparison with the 3 other wavelengths. After
the coagulation process the shape of the curves was similar. The absorption decreased
with increasing dosage of coagulant; the color removal efficiency was more or less the
same at all used wavelengths: 91% at 455 nm (Pt-Co), and 94 % at 436 nm, 525 nm and
95% for 620 nm. As mentioned in chapter 2, the Vietnamese standard color limit
allowance uses Pt-Co as a unit, therefore the single method with unit of Pt-Co was
chosen to measure color for all experiments. 90 Absorption at 4 different wavelengths of mixed

Figure 3.15: Measured absorption at 4 different wavelengths for mixed wastewater
as a function of pH and the dosage of Al2(SO4)3.18H2O Poly aluminum chloride (PAC) Two wastewater streams (disperse & reactive dyes and vat dyes) were coagulated with
PAC. At a constant coagulant dosage of 500 mg/L the color removal efficiency at pH
values varying from 6 to 8.6 for disperse & reactive dyes wastewater and from 6 to 9 for
vat dyes wastewater were investigated. For disperse & reactive dyes the highest color removal efficiency (64%) was obtained at
a pH value of 6.5. For vat dyes the best color removal efficiency (96%) was obtained at
pH 8.0. At optimal the pH of 6.5 for disperse and reactive dye wastewater the optimal PAC
coagulant dosage was 800 mg/L with a color removal efficiency of 77%. For vat dyes
wastewater at optimal pH 8.0 an increase in coagulant dosage from 600-900 mg/L
resulted in an increase in the color removal efficiency from 55 to 96%. The color
removal efficiency hardly changed when the dosage of coagulant was further increased
from 1,000 to 1,200 mg/L. The COD removal efficiency of vat dyes and disperse & reactive dyes wastewater were
more or less the same: 74 and 76% at optimal conditions (For vat dyes wastewater was
at pH 8.0 and dosage of 900mg/L. For disperse & reactive dyes wastewater was at pH
6.5 and dosage of 800mg/L). The color removal efficiency for vat dyes wastewater was in general higher than for
disperse & reactive dyes wastewater. In Figure 3.16 and 3.17 the effect of pH and the
coagulant doses on the color removal efficiency are shown. 91 Disperse and reactive dyes wastewater

and disperse & acid dyes wastewater. The effect of pH is represented in Figure 3.18. In
these experiments a fixed coagulant dosage of 700 mg/L for disperse & reactive dyes
wastewater and 1,000 mg/L for vat dyes and disperse & acid dyes wastewater was
applied. The best results were obtained at pH 9 for disperse & acid dyes, vat dyes, and
at pH 11 for disperse & reactive dyes wastewater. It was observed that at pH 8 the vat
dyes wastewater got very turbid, and the color of the wastewater became darker, so that
the color intensity strongly increased resulting in negative removal efficiency. Similar
results were found for disperse & acid dyes wastewater at pH 11. The effect of FeSO4 dosages at optimal pH on the color removal efficiency for the three
wastewater streams is presented in Figure 3.19. The optimal dosage for disperse &
reactive dyes wastewater at fixed pH of 11 was 800 mg/L resulting in a color removal
efficiency of 78% and a COD removal efficiency of 84%. For vat dyes wastewater the
effect of FeSO4 dosages on the color removal efficiency was tested at the optimal pH of
9. The optimal dosage for vat dyes wastewater was 1,600 mg/L with a color removal
efficiency of 94% and a COD removal efficiency of 76%. For disperse & acid dye 92 Disperse and reactive dyes wastewater

63 For disperse & reactive dyes wastewater, the efficiency of aluminum sulfate, ferrous
sulfate, and poly aluminum chloride is more or less similar. The maximum color
removal efficiency was around 76-79% and the COD removal efficiency ranged from
74-84%. However, the remaining color after coagulation was in the range of 285-310
Pt-Co which is too high to meet the Vietnamese regulation discharge standard of color
(50 Pt-Co) with only one treatment step. The explanation could be that the untreated
wastewater contains a larger amount of reactive dyes than disperse dyes, based on the
typical fixation aspects of these dyestuffs. The fixation of disperse dyes is about 90-95%
and for the reactive dyes this is 60-90%. The coagulation process was more effective in
color removal of the insoluble disperse dyes and less for the soluble reactive dyes. Even
though the amount of remaining reactive dyes in the wastewater was higher than the
disperse dyes, the color removal efficiency that could be achieved was 79%. This
proved that also soluble reactive dyes could be removed by an adsorptive mechanism of
soluble reactive dyes on the flocs which were formed in the coagulation/flocculation
process. Among the three tested coagulants aluminum sulfate achieved the highest color
removal efficiency. For disperse & reactive dyes wastewater the estimated operational
costs for achieving optimal conditions for aluminum sulfate was 0.2US$/m3 wastewater. For vat dyes wastewater the results show that the coagulation process was also a very
effective means of color and COD removal, especially for color removal. The aluminum
sulfate gave the highest color removal efficiency (98%) reducing the color down to 30
Pt-Co, the lowest value achieved with the four types of wastewater. The COD removal
was 78% (62 mg O2/L). The estimated operational costs are 0.27US$/m3 wastewater.
Use of PAC and FeSO4 coagulants also achieved a high efficiency (95 and 96%) but
needed more coagulant: PAC 900 mg/L and FeSO4.7H2O 1,600 mg/L. The vat dyes are
only applied in the dyeing and finishing process of P.TC 277 fabric. The remaining vat
dyes in the wastewater of this process were about 5% of the initial dye concentration.
These remaining vat dyes are relatively insoluble and therefore they could be
completely removed by a coagulation process. 95 Al2(SO4)3.18H2O

The coagulation process with ferrous sulfate of disperse & acid dyes wastewater gave
the lowest color removal efficiency (64%) compared to the color removal efficiency of
the other wastewater streams (disperse & reactive dyes, vat dyes, and mixed
wastewater). Although a high dosage of coagulants (2,000 mg Al2(SO4)3.18H2O/L or
1,200 mg FeSO4/L) were used a noticeable color remained. This can be explained by
considering the composition of the wastewater. This still contained a high concentration
of acid dyes after the coagulation process. Before coagulation the wastewater contained
5-10% of the initial amount of the disperse & acid dyes. After the coagulation step,
disperse dyes could have been removed almost completely by the coagulation process
but acid dyes could not. As mentioned in chapter 2, acid dyes are highly soluble dyes,
which are less efficient to be removed with the application of a coagulation/flocculation
process. Costs were not calculated for the application. For mixed wastewater, coagulation with aluminum sulfate showed a high removal
efficiency for color (92%) and for COD (81%). The used dosage was lower (400 mg/L)
than for the three other wastewater streams. This might be because at the equalization
tank the concentrated wastewater streams were diluted by other less polluted wastewater
streams, and as a consequence, it could be easier to reach the optimal conditions for the
coagulation process.  For mixed wastewater, the estimated operational costs to achieve
optimal conditions for aluminum sulfate was 0.15US$/m3 wastewater. At optimal pH, but with a lower than optimal dosage of coagulant, the color increased
resulting in less or negative removal (see graph 3.13 d) efficiency. The reason is that
insufficient coagulant amount has been added to destabilize colloidal particles or to
reduce the surface charge, in which case the coagulation process may not yet occur. As
a result, a less effective efficiency of color removal was achieved compared to optimal
conditions. 96 PAC

Effect of temperature on the coagulation/flocculation process In the experiments aimed to evaluate the effect of temperature on the
coagulation/flocculation process mixed wastewater was used at the optimal pH of 5 and
dosage of aluminum sulfate of 400 mg/L. In Figure 3.21 the effect of varying the temperature on the color removal efficiency of
the coagulation process is shown. Results show that within the studied temperature
range of 30-500C there was only a small effect on the color removal efficiency. So
cooling down of the wastewater to ambient temperatures is in general not necessary for
textile wastewater. Figure 3.21: Effect of temperature on the color of mixed wastewater, at optimum
aluminum sulfate dosage and pH
3.3.4 Conclusions The results of the experiments clearly showed that the coagulation process is a very
effective means for color removal of disperse & reactive dyes, vat dyes, and mixed
wastewater. This study indicated that experimentally found optimal pH values are in
agreement with literature data. Optimal pH varies between pH 5 and about 7 for
aluminum sulfate, between 6.5 and 9 for poly aluminum chloride, and between 9 and 11
for ferrous sulfate. These experiments revealed that pH affects the coagulation process
significantly. With proper pH control it was possible to achieve high color removal
efficiencies at smaller coagulant dosage. As can be seen from section 3.1 only pH
adjustments did not have a significant effect on the efficiency of color removal. As already mentioned it was found in literature that the dosage of coagulant found to
achieve a high color removal efficiency was in the range from 200-1,500mg/L. In this
study, the color removal with high efficiency can be obtained with optimal coagulant
dosages in a range from 400-1,000 mg/L. The dosage of used coagulants will depend on
the characteristics and concentration of remaing dyestuffs in the wastewater. Adding
more coagulant than the optimal dosage achieved little improvement in the color
removal efficiency. Although coagulation processes can remove a significant amount of
color and COD in textile wastewater, only a coagulation step by it self can not meet the 98 discharge standards. In agreement with reports of some studies (Stahr, 1980; Takur,
1994) this study also found that the coagulation process did not only remove insoluble
dyestuffs but also soluble dyestuffs by the absorption mechanism, especially reactive
dyes. In addition the coagulation process does not increase in EC of wastewater which
is one of the important factors in wastewater reuse and in meeting discharge standards.
Temperatures in the range between 30 and 500C have a small effect on the coagulation
process. A drawback of coagulation processes is that it generates sludge which has to be
treated further and that it will increase the operational costs of a wastewater treatment
system. Among the three studied coagulants (aluminum sulfate, poly aluminum chloride, and
ferrous sulfate) aluminum sulfate is relatively the most effective coagulant in color
removal. It is also the cheapest coagulant at present.
3.4 Advanced oxidation processes 3.4.1 Introduction In order to meet the strict discharge standards for color (50 Pt-Co) and COD (80 mg
O2/L) or to make reuse of the effluence possible, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs)
could be considered to satisfy these strict standards. According to literature (Churchley
1994; Tünay et al. 1996; Liakou et al. 1997; Shyh and H. M. Chang 1997; Vandevivere
et al. 1998; Ledakowicz et al. 2001; Karahan et al. 2002; Mattioli et al. 2002; Baban et
al. 2003; Lucas et al. 2007) the AOPs represent the most widely used chemical methods
for treatment of textile wastewater and the application of AOPs are found to be effective
in the decolorization, COD reduction, and enhancing the biodegradability of textile
wastewater. The AOPs can be applied as a pre-treatment step to convert complex
organic molecules (non-biodegradable) into simple molecules which often represent
more biodegradable substrates (Oliver et al. 2000; Chamarro et al. 2001) or as a
polishing step in wastewater treatment systems to meet the strict discharge standards or
reuse standard (Lin and Liu 1994; Tzitzi et al. 1994; Strickland and Perkins 1995;
Churchley 1998; Sigge et al. 2001). However, some literature data also show different
results due to differences in the complexity of the wastewater. The purpose of this part
of the research was to find a suitable AOPs practice for color and COD removal of
textile wastewater. More specifically the object of this study focused on investigation of
efficiency of three AOP methods for five types of textile wastewater streams and the
effect of temperature on the AOPs color removal efficiency. The goal was to assess the removal of color for five types of wastewater streams
(disperse & reactive dyes, vat dyes, disperse & acid dyes, acid dyes, and mixed
wastewater) with the three AOPs which have been used widely in the practice of color
removal. These AOPs are the application of O3, O3/H2O2, and Fenton’s reagent. 99 O3 Regarding the application of O3 as reported in literature it is observed that many textile
wastewater studies (Matsui et al. 1981; Gaehr et al. 1994; Sarasa et al. 1998; Wu et al.
1998) have focused on the color removal applying ozone at difference pH values. At
values of pH>8 indirect reactions between ozone and organic compounds occur via
hydroxyl radicals. In an acid environment, ozone will directly react with the organic
compounds. The direct ozonation of dyestuffs is a much faster reaction than the reaction
of radicals. Several results show that a pH in the range of 3 to 11 only slightly affects
the efficiency of color and COD removal (Namboodri et al. 1994; Perkins et al. 1995;
Kabdal et al. 2002; Selcuk  and Meric 2006). In addition, adjustment of pH to a very
high or low pH will increase the electric conductivity of effluent and operational costs
of wastewater treatment system. In the experiments described in this paragraph,
ozonation was carried out at the original pH of five raw wastewater streams in which
four wastewater streams are collected from the 28 Company-Agtex and one artificial
wastewater at two pH values: artificial wastewater containing only dye at pH 5 and
artificial wastewater with dye, salts, and lubic-Co (lubricant used for dyestuff fixation
enhancement) at pH 11.2.
As mentioned in literature (chapter 2), the optimal dosage of ozone that results in a
complete decolorization ranged from 30-2,400 mg O3/L. For artificial wastewater the
ozone dosage necessary for decolorization is in general lower than for real wastewater.
From literature results it can be concluded that application of a large ozone dosage is
not feasible because ozonation is very expensive. In our experiments the applied ozone
dosage was relatively low and was varied in a range from 20-200 mg O3/L for artificial
wastewater and 30-600 mg O3/L for real wastewater depending on characteristics and
color intensity of each wastewater stream. The presence of particles (suspended solids or colloidal particles) in wastewater is one
of the important factors that will affect the efficiency of AOPs. However, only few
literature data for effect of particles have been published. Textile industries, as
mentioned in chapter 2, usually use a high concentration of several inorganic salts in the
dyeing process. The remaining salt concentration in wastewater is important for the
effect of ozone on impurities in textile wastewater. Therefore, in this study the effects of
particles and of salts on the performance AOPs were experimentally evaluated using
artificial wastewater, and subsequently with real wastewaters. The experiments with
particle free wastewater were carried out with filtered or centrifuged wastewater. Two
types of salt, (NaCl and Na2CO3) were used in the experiments. Lubic-Co (particles)
was used to investigate the influence of particles on the oxidation process. Lubic-Co is
an additive in textile processing that consists of small particles and is present in real
textile wastewater. In the experiments, the removal efficiency of suspended solids, total
COD (CODtotal), particulate COD (CODpart), dissolved COD (CODdis), suspended solids
COD (CODss) and colloidal COD (CODcol) were investigated. 100 O3/H2O2 As already mentioned in chapter 2, an optimal H2O2/O3 mol ratio of 0.5 was reported in
literature. However, this ratio can drastically change due to the wastewater composition,
especially by the presence of scavengers in the wastewater. In order to assess the effect
of the mol ratio of H2O2/O3 on the removal efficiencies of the chosen parameters, the
experiments were carried out at the optimal ozone dosage and varying the dosage of
H2O2 between 140 to 280 mg/L. Fenton’ reagent In literature an optimal pH range between pH 3 and 5 for Fenton’s reagent is reported
(Kuo 1992; Sevimli and Kinaci 2002). In order to assess the effect of pH, the
experiments were performed at pHs varying in the range between 2 to 5, at a fixed H2O2
and Fe2+ dosage. For determination of the optimal dosage of hydrogen peroxide, the experiment was
performed at hydrogen peroxide dosages varying between 30 and 2,260 mg H2O2/L,
depended on the characteristics of the wastewater streams.
For determination of optimal iron dosage the iron (Fe2+) dosage was varied between 20
and 223 mg Fe2+/L at optimal pH and H2O2 dosage. Assessment the effect of temperature on AOPs Textile wastewater usually has a high temperature, and a pretreatment step is used to
decrease the temperature of the wastewater before it is treated in a next treatment step
(Oliver et al. 2000; Kabdal et al. 2002). This cooling step adds operational costs for the
wastewater treatment plant. To assess the influence of temperature on the color removal,
experiments at temperatures 30, 40, and 600C were performed, at optimal conditions
(established previously) for ozone oxidation and Fenton’s reagent. 3.4.2 Materials and methods
Apparatus O3 experiments The reactor used in the experiment consisted of a double walled glass cylinder with an
inlet for ozone supply, outlet for ozone discharge and pH measurement. The total
volume of reactor was 1.5 L. The reactor had an internal diameter of 9 cm and a height
of 24 cm. The ozone was introduced through a stainless steel diffuser. A stirrer, at a
speed of 60 rpm, was used for the homogeneous distribution of the ozone in the
wastewater. The ozone was supplied by an ozone generator. Teflon tubing and
connectors were used. The set-up is shown in Figure 3.22. Two ozone generators were used for the experiments. The first ozone generator
(Sorbios, model GSG 001) was fed with pure oxygen gas (HoekLoos, the Netherlands).
A concentration of 1.1% v/v ozone in the gas mixture was used, at a controlled feed rate
of 17.7 L/hr. The second generator was a Dozomax model (Vietnam), at a controlled 101 feed rate of 11.7 L/hr, and a capacity of 1 g O3/hr, using dry air. In order to mix the
ozone and wastewater, a magnetic stirrer was used during the experiments. The magnetic stirrer
(model 375 of VWR , USA) had a speed control up to 2,000 rpm. O3/H2O2  experiments The oxidation experiments with O3/H2O2 were carried out with the same reactor system
as used in the O3 experiments. In these experiments, the hydrogen peroxide dosage was
injected into the reactor through one of the inlet of the reactor. Figure 3.22: Ozone reactor set-up Fenton’s reagent experiment A jar test apparatus model JLT6 (Velp Scientifiza, the Netherlands) was used in the Fenton’s
reagent experiments for the determination of the optimal pH, dosage of H2O2, and
dosage of catalyst (Fe2+). The jar test set-up used was the same as in the coagulation
experiments. The set-up is presented in Figure 3.11. Chemicals The chemicals used in the experiments are pure grade and were obtained from Merck: -
Hydrogen peroxide 30% (H2O2) was used in Fenton’s reagent, and in the ozone
experiments.
-
Ferrous sulfate (FeSO4.7H2O) was used in Fenton’s reagent experiments.
-
Na2S2O3 and KI were used in the determination of the ozone concentration by
titration.
-
Na2CO3 and NaCl were used to assess the effect of scavengers in AOPs.
-
H2SO4 or NaOH solutions made from concentrated H2SO4 (95-98%) or NaOH
(98%) pellets and diluted with demineralized water to obtain the desired
concentration of 5-10%. These were used for pH adjustment. Analytical methods The analyses were performed according to Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater (APHA, 2005). 102 The COD was measured with the closed reflux, titrimetric method, five types of COD
were determined as follows: -
Well mixed total (raw) wastewater samples were used for measuring the total
COD (CODtotal).
-
The supernatant of the raw wastewater after filtration with pore size of 1.2 µm
was used as sample for the measurement of the particulate COD (CODpart). -
The supernatant after filtration with pore size of 0.45 µm was used for
measuring the dissolved COD (CODdis).
-
The suspended solids COD (CODss) and colloidal COD (CODcol) were
calculated as follows:
COD ss = CODtotal – CODpart;
CODcol =  CODpart - CODdis. -
BOD: 5-day BOD test at 200C.
Alkalinity was determined by titration with a standard acid solution.
Color intensity of a Vietnamese wastewater was measured with a spectrophotometer
(Hach GENESYS*20) at a wavelength of 455 nm. The color is expressed in Pt-Co
units. For wastewater of the UCO textile factory, Belgium, the color intensity was
determined by scanning for the best absorbance within wavelength range of 200 to 700
nm with a UV-vis spectrophotometer. The dominant wavelength for that wastewater
was 616 nm. For determining the color intensity of artificial wastewater from a recipe of
the GVA textile Company in Aalten, the Netherlands the same procedure was
performed. The dominant wavelength was 416 nm. Turbidity was measured with a spectrophotometer (Hach GENESYS*20) at a
wavelength of 450 nm, and is expressed in FAU (Formazin Attenuation Unit). Residual hydrogen peroxide (0.1 - 6%) was determined with the iodometric titration
method or with a “Nanocolor Peroxid 2” test kit. The principle of the iodometric
titration method is that H2O2 oxidizes iodide to iodine in the presence of acid and
molybdate as a catalyst. The formed iodine is titrated with a standard thiosulfate
solution, with starch as an indicator. The “Nanocolor Peroxid 2” kit uses change in color
intensity, measured with a spectrophotometer, as a measure for the amount of H2O2. The ozone concentration of samples was monitored by means of a Varian DMS 100
spectrophotometer, at a wavelength of 259 nm. The ozone concentration was also
determined with the iodide method (KI method). In this method the ozone oxidizes
iodide to iodine in an acid environment (pH=2). The formed iodine is titrated with a
standard thiosulfate solution, with starch as an indicator.
The pH was determined with a pH meter model MP220, manufactured by Mettler
Toledo – Switzerland, which measures between pH 0 and 14 with accuracy 0.01.
The electrical conductivity (EC) was measured with a conductivity meter model
Sension 5 manufactured by Hach, USA, with a range of 0 – 1999 µS/cm. The temperature was measured with a thermometer (0-1000C).
Type of wastewaters The experiments were performed with textile wastewaters from three sources. The first
was collected from the 28 Company-Agtex in Vietnam. The composition of these 103 wastewaters is mentioned in section 3.1.2. The second wastewater was obtained from
the UCO textile factory, Belgium. The last one, an artificial wastewater, was prepared
according to a recipe of the GVA textile Company in Aalten, the Netherlands. This
artificial wastewater was used to study the effects of salts and particles on the
performance of AOPs. Table 3.3 and 3.4 present composition and some of the
characteristics of wastewater from dyeing process of the UCO textile factory and
artificial wastewater of GVA textile Company. The artificial wastewater includes a
reactive dye -blue navy- (16.3 mg /L), commercial name RB 171 reactive dye, and
auxiliary chemicals such as sodium chloride (20 g/L), sodium carbonate (5 g/L), and
lubic-Co (0.6 ml/L). Lubic Co is the source of the suspended solids in the wastewater.
As can be seen in Table 3.3 the concentration of suspended solids in the sample with
reactive dye, salts and lubic-Co was 290 mg/L while the concentration of the suspended
solids in the two remaining samples was 0 mg/L. In addition, Lubic-Co is the main the
cause of COD in the artificial wastewater samples. The reactive dye and lubic-Co were
supplied by the Aalten textile Company. The dosage of used dye in experiments was
calculated using the typical fixation percentage of 70% for a reactive dye and 30% the
dye was discharged into the wastewater. The other chemicals were added following a
recipe for a real dyeing batch.

Variation in the dyeing wastewater quality depends on type of dye used and production
capacity. The dyeing process wastewater of the UCO textile factory (Belgium) had
mostly a dark color like dark blue and black. The color was the main pollutant of the
wastewater generated from the dyeing process. The absorbance of this sample was 2.85
at wavelength of 616 nm. The results presented in Table 3.4 show that the ratio of
BOD/COD was very low at around 4%. The pH of sample was slightly acidic. 104 Table 3.4: Dyeing process wastewater composition, using acid dye (UCO textile

Source: Bisschops and  Spanjers (2002) O3 experiments One liter of raw wastewater was used for each of the experiments. The gas phase and
wastewater were mixed by a magnetic stirrer. In this study, the effect of ozone dosages
between 20 and 600 mg/L was investigated at the original pH of the wastewater. Both
the ingoing and outgoing ozone concentration were determined to quantify the ozone
consumption during the experiment. In the KI method the residual ozone was absorbed
in a 2% potassium iodide solution (KI). Samples of the treated wastewater were
collected at the regular time intervals of 5, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes for the
determination of pH, color, turbidity, alkalinity, and conductivity. The COD was only
determined at optimal conditions. The pH was measured continuously during the
experiment. The influent and effluent from some experiments were centrifuged at a
speed of 4,000 rpm to remove particles. The supernatant was used for analysis. O3/H2O2 experiments Oxidation by O3/H2O2 was performed in a similar way as in the ozone experiments. Two
experiments were carried out at optimal ozone concentration and at different hydrogen
peroxide concentrations. The hydrogen peroxide concentration was varied between 140
to 280 mg/L. After the ozone generator was turned on, the experiments were started by
injecting 0.425 µL or 0.850 µL of 30% hydrogen peroxide solution into the reactor. The
total reaction time of each experiment was about 240 minutes. At regular time intervals
of 5, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes samples were collected to determine the pH, color,
suspended solids, residual hydrogen peroxide, and COD. 105 Fenton’s reagent experiments The experiments with Fenton’s reagent were carried out using the jar test apparatus. Six
beakers of volume 1,000 mL with 500 mL of wastewater per beaker were used for all
experiments. The dosages of oxidant and pH adjustment solutions (H2SO4 or NaOH)
were added into the wastewater simultaneously. The jar test was conducted with 1
minute rapid mixing at 100 rpm, followed by 30 min slow mixing at 30 rpm to allow
completion of the reaction. Then the samples were left to settle for 30 minutes before
the supernatant was collected for the determination of the pH, color, turbidity, EC, and
COD. The complete time period of the assay was about 60 minutes. 3.4.3 Results and discussion Effects of salts, particles on the O3 process efficiency for treating artificial
wastewater of the Aalten textile company, the Netherlands The wastewater characteristics are listed in Table 3.3. For artificial wastewater
containing dye, the absorbance of the sample slightly increased after addition of NaCl,
Na2CO3, and lubic-Co compared to the sample containing only reactive dye. The main
increase of absorbance came from adding lubic-Co. The absorbance of only reactive dye
in the sample was 0.301, 0.317 after adding salts, and 0.347 after adding lubic-Co. The absorbance of only reactive dye in the sample was 0.301, 0.327 after adding salts,
and 0.347 after adding lubic-Co. Results showed that reactive dye (RB 171) did not
cause a high COD in the wastewater (23 mg O2/L). The high COD was usually due to
auxiliary chemicals like lubic-Co: 395 mg O2/L (wastewater containing reactive dye,
salts and lubic-Co). In Figure 3.23 the color intensity (absorbance) of the wastewaters is
plotted against the ozone dosage for the artificial wastewater with only reactive dye,
with reactive dye and salts, and with reactive dye, salt and lubic-Co. From this figure
the effect of salts and lubic-Co on the color removal in the wastewater by ozonation can
be derived. Although the experiments with only reactive dye and reactive dye plus salts
were performed at different pHs, results indicate that complete decolorization of the
wastewaters occurred within 20 minutes. The absorbance decreased from 0.500 to 0.055
(with an absorbance of 0.055 the wastewater was almost colorless). The explanation
might be that the mechanism of the decolorization in these experiments occurred due to
direct attack of the dye molecules by molecular ozone for the wastewater containing
only reactive dye (pH of 5.1), and indirectly by hydroxyl radicals for the wastewater
containing reactive dye & salts (pH 11.2). This proves that sodium chloride and sodium
carbonate did hardly affect the ozonation process. These results are in agreement with
the results found by Schmelling 1997; Sotelo 1989; Hoigne’ 1998; Liao 2001; Tanaka
2002, and Boncz 2002.
However, the complete decolorization of artificial wastewater containing reactive dye,
salts, and lubic-Co was about 240 minutes. This shows that particles (expressed in terms
of lubic-Co) had a large effect on time and dosage of ozone needed for color removal.
Instead of the 20 minutes with dosage of 11.3 mg O3/L needed for complete
decolorization (absorbance ≈0.06) of the reactive dye and reactive dye & salts samples,
the sample containing reactive dye, salts and lubic-Co took 240 minutes with dosage of
121.2 mg O3/L to obtain a final absorbance of 0.10. 106 0.00

dye, salts and lubic-Co Although the ozonation process had a treatment efficiency of 99 % in terms of color
removal, the COD appeared to be unaffected. The COD removal efficiency was 11% for
wastewater that contained reactive dye & salts, 18% for wastewater containing dye,
salts & lubic-Co, and 21% for wastewater with only dye. In order to completely remove
COD with ozone, a large amount of oxidant is needed. This is very expensive and
regarded unfeasible. Lubic-Co is the source of the suspended (colloidal) particles in
wastewater. These particles can not be removed by centrifugation. Figure 3.24 shows
that the absorbance behavior of wastewater samples containing reactive dye, salts, and
lubic-Co did not change with centrifugation. The lubic-Co colloidal particles inhibited
the contact between ozone and soluble pollutants and consumed (partially) ozone. This
explains why the wastewater containing dye, salts, and lubic-Co took more than 4 hours
for complete decolorization in comparison with the 20 minutes for the wastewater
without lubic-Co. During the ozonation experiment, the pH of the wastewater with only reactive dye
changed considerably from 5.1 to 3.7 within the 20 minutes reaction time. This was not
the case for the wastewater containing reactive dye & salts and reactive dye, salts &
lubic-Co. The pH values of these wastewaters were more or less the same (from 11.2
down to 11.15) after 240 minutes reaction time. The reason for that is that the acids
generated during the experiments were neutralized by the buffering effect of the salts
present in reactive dye & salts and reactive dye, salts & lubic-Co wastewater. This result
shows that the ozonation process causes a decrease pH of unbuffered wastewater. Figure 3.23: Effect of ozonation dosages (≈ ozonation time) on the color intensity of

the Netherlands In Figure 3.25 the effect of ozonation dosage (proportional to the ozonation time) on the
color intensity of artificial wastewaters containing reactive dyes, salts, and lubic-Co is
illustrated. Parameter is the added amount of H2O2. From the figure it will be clear that
the color intensity of the wastewater is much more and faster reduced using only O3
than with O3/H2O2. The efficiency of the process with O3 and H2O2 hardly changed
even when the H2O2 dosage was increased two times. Hoigne’ et al. (1998) states that
when hydrogen peroxide is added to the solution (wastewater) it may improve the
solubility of the ozone in the liquid phase, and consequently improve the conversion of
ozone into radicals resulting in an increase of the efficiency. Figure 3.26(a) and (b)
depict the outgoing, ingoing and consumption of ozone in the absence and presence of
hydrogen peroxide for artificial wastewater containing reactive dye, salts, and lubic-Co
at a pH value of 12. Results indicate that the mass transfer of the ozone in the liquid
phase was increased when H2O2 was present, since the concentration of the outgoing
ozone is almost zero during the experimental time of 240 minutes. The obtained results
prove that adding H2O2 improves the solubility of the ozone in the liquid phase.
Although consumption of ozone in the O3/H2O2 experiment increased, the color removal
efficiency decreased. This decreased efficiency can be explained by the destruction of
hydroxyl radicals by the excess of H2O2. The residual H2O2 was 5.9 when 140 mg/L
H2O2 was applied and 13.9 mg/L for a dosage of 280 mg/L. The H2O2 can act as a
scavenger following the equation: OH  + H2O2   H2O + HO2 (Walling 1975) This experiment demonstrated that there is probably an optimum ratio of H2O2:O3 and
this optimal ratio of H2O2:O3 has to be determined in practice for each wastewater. The
pH hardly changed during the experiment (pH 11.2) because the generated acid
products during the treatment process were buffered by the high concentrations of
Na2CO3 in the sample. The ozone remains in the favorable pH range for effective
degradation of the wastewater. 108 0.00

after ozonation of the artificial wastewaters. Total COD reduced unsignificantly in both
experiments. There was a conversion CODss and CODcol into CODdis resulting in a
decrease of the CODss and CODcol and an increase in CODdis. The suspended solids
concentration increased due to the formation of Na2CO3 precipitate. Moreover the
oxidation process using O3 or O3/H2O2 could not or hardly improve the biodegradability
of artificial wastewaters. On the contrary, results of Selcuk and Meric (2006) and
Mattioli et al. (2002) showed that a combination of O3/H2O2 could improve color
removal and biodegradability of effluents. Therefore an experiment was performed only
applying ozone (Table 3.5). O3 (30%reactive dye,100%NaCl &Na2CO3, 60%lubic-Co)

O3 process for treating real textile wastewater of UCO textile factory, Gent
(Belgium)
Acid dyes wastewater The wastewater from the dyeing & finishing step of the UCO textile factory, Gent
(Belgium) had a high color intensity (black), COD and suspended solids content, a low
pH of 4.6, and a very low BOD/COD ratio. At the dominant wavelength of 616 nm for
measuring the wastewater’s color absorbance of the color intensity was 2.85. In Figure
3.27, the effect of ozonation on the color intensity of filtered and not filtered acid dyes
wastewaters is shown. Results indicate that the color intensity of the unfiltered
wastewater slightly decreases (15%) after 240 minutes ozonation. However, just
filtering reduced the absorbance of wastewater sample approximately 85% compared to
the unfiltered raw wastewater, from 2.85 down to 0.42. The efficiency of color removal
from the filtered wastewater with ozonation increased (efficiency 62% at dosage of
107.6 mg O3/L, and 83% at dosage of 226 mg O3/L). However, the corresponding COD
reduction was almost negligible for both filtered and not-filtered samples. Figure 3.27: Effect of ozone dosage (≈ ozonation time) on the color intensity of
filtered (pore size 1.2 µm) and unfiltered acid dye wastewaters of the UCO textile
factory, Gent (Belgium) 110 Disperse & reactive dyes, vat dyes, disperse & acid dyes, and mixed wastewaters
from 28 Company-Agtex, Vietnam
Unfiltered wastewater streams The effects of ozone dosage on the color intensity and removal efficiencies of three
unfiltered wastewater streams of the 28 Company-Agtex are shown in Figure 3.28 (a),
(b), and (c). For disperse & reactive dyes wastewater (Figure 3.28 a) the color removal efficiency
increased with increased ozone dosage. At 30 mg O3/L the color intensity dropped from
1,345 to 775 Pt-Co corresponding with a removal efficiency of 43%. At an ozone
dosage of 200 mg O3/L the remaining color was 305 Pt-Co (77% color removal
efficiency). Ozonation decreased the pH from 8.6 to 7.9 for the disperse & reactive dyes
wastewater and the electrical conductivity hardly changed, even at the highest ozone
dosage. As is shown in Figure 3.28(b), the color removal efficiency of the vat dye wastewater
was quite low compared to disperse & reactive dyes wastewater. The highest color
removal efficiency achieved was only 27% at a dosage of 200 mg O3/L. Ozonation
decreased the pH from 11 to 9.0 for the vat dyes wastewater and the electrical
conductivity of the wastewaters hardly changed, even at the highest ozone dosage. The results of the experiments with disperse & reactive dyes and vat dyes wastewater
indicate that even at the highest applied ozone dosage (200 mg O3/L) the achieved color
removal did not meet the Vietnamese discharge regulations regarding color of 50 Pt-Co. Because the color intensity and COD of the mixed wastewater was higher than that of
the disperse & reactive dyes and vat dyes wastewater the applied ozone dosage for the
mixed wastewater was increased from 20 to 600 mg O3/L. The results in Figure 3.29(c)
show that with dosages up to 50 mg O3/L the color intensity hardly changed. Up to 100
mg O3/L the color removal efficiency was only 5%, at 200 mg O3/L it was 16%, and
reached 57% at a dosage of 600 mg O3/L. The decrease of the pH was the highest for
the mixed wastewater: from 10.8 to 7.0. The color removal efficiency of the disperse & reactive dye was higher than that of vat
dyes, and mixed wastewater. Complete decolorization of the three wastewater streams
with applied maximum amounts of ozone was not achieved probably due to the
influence of the initial high color intensity, the presence of particles, or the high COD. Results show that turbidity decreased with increased the ozone dosage. Some of the
dyestuffs in the wastewaters of these experiments were insoluble dyestuffs such as the
disperse dyes and vat dyes. They are present in the wastewater as colloidal particles or
suspended solids which caused the turbidity of wastewater samples. The results show
that very probably the insoluble dyestuffs can be converted to a soluble form by the
oxidation process with ozone. This is the reason why the turbidity was decreased for all
experiments. Figure 3.29 shows the effect of ozone dosage on the alkalinity of both
disperse & reactive dyes and vat dyes wastewaters. The alkalinity of the disperse & 111 Disperse & reactive dyes wastewater

reactive dyes wastewater decreased significantly at an ozone dosage of 30 mg O3/L,
from 400 to 110 mg CaCO3/L, and it remained almost constant as the ozone dosage
increased further. There is a relationship between the alkalinity consumption and the
highest color removal efficiency (43%) at 30 mg O3/L and pH 8.6 with disperse &
reactive dyes wastewater. The indirect oxidation by radicals can probably break the
bond of the choromorphore group in the dyestuff to form acid products such as
HCOOH, CH3COOH, oxalic acid, H2CO3, ect. These acids caused the consumption of
the alkalinity in the wastewater. (a) (b) (c)

streams Filtered wastewater streams To study the effect of particles (suspended solids) on the efficiency of the ozonation
process the experiments reported above were repeated, but this time the particles of
three wastewater streams were removed by filtration using a sand filter. The filtration step by itself reduced also the value of some parameters of the raw
wastewater. This was especially true for the color intensity which then decreased 20%
for disperse & acid dyes and the mixed wastewater, 53% for vat dyes wastewater and
72% for disperse & reactive dyes wastewater. In comparison with non-filtered and
filtered wastewater, the color removal efficiency of filtered wastewater by the ozonation
process was the same (26%) for the vat dyes wastewater (with ozone dosages of 200
mg/L) and it increased from 55% (unfiltered) to 72% (filtered) for mixed wastewater
(with ozone dosages of 500 mg/L). However, the color removal efficiency decreased for
disperse & reactive dyes wastewater from 77% (unfiltered) to 61% (filtered). Figure
3.30 (a), (b), (c), and (d) shows the effect of ozone dosage on the color intensity and
color removal efficiency for the filtered wastewaters. Results show that increased ozone dosage reduces the color intensity of the four filtered
wastewaters. Among the four wastewater streams, disperse & acid dyes wastewater had
the highest color removal efficiency at a ozone dosage of 200 mg O3/L, namely 79%,
followed by the disperse & reactive dyes wastewater with a color removal efficiency of
61%, which was higher than the color removal efficiency of mixed wastewater (52%)
and vat dyes wastewater (26%) at the same ozone dosage (200 mg O3/L). In these experiments with effect of ozone dosage in reduction of the color intensity of
four wastewater streams, the pH of all experiments decreased with increasing ozone
dose. The change in pH was only substantial with mixed wastewater which  pH
decreased from 11.4 to 9.0. 113 Disperse &  reactive dyes wastewater

E% (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 3.30: (a), (b), (c), and (d): The effect of ozone dosage on color intensity and
removal efficiency of four filtered wastewater streams The different color removal efficiencies of the four wastewater streams is due to the
type of fixation process of the different dyestuffs in the dyeing process resulting in the
different concentrations of dyestuffs in the wastewater, pH (the pH of disperse &
reactive, vat, mixed and disperse & acid dyes wastewater was 8.1, 8.5, 11.2, and 5.9),
and dependent on the characteristics of dyestuffs. The vat dyes wastewater contained
insoluble vat dyes as colloidal particles. These colloidal particles could not be removed
by the filtration step with the result that the ozone process hardly had an effect on the
filtered sample. For disperse & acid dyes wastewater at acid conditions (pH 5.9), ozone
should become a direct oxidation agent rather than an indirect one. Direct oxidation by
molecular ozone is known to be efficient for decolorization of dyestuffs by breaking the
double bond in the dyestuff molecule. At high pH values (disperse & reactive, vat, and
mixed wastewater) the indirect oxidation by means of hydroxyl radicals is in general
less efficient in color removal of dyestuffs than molecular ozone. The oxidation with
molecular ozone is much more selective than oxidation by hydroxyl radicals. Table 3.6
(a) and (b) presents the color removal efficiencies of four filtered and non-filtered
wastewater streams with ozone. 114 Table 3.6 (a): Color removal efficiency (E%) of filtered and non-filtered disperse

Note: * Not tested The results are in agreement with literature which states that the ozonation process is
very effective for treatment of acid and reactive dyes (soluble dyes) while disperse and
vat dyes (insoluble dyes) are more resistant (Marmagne et al. 1996; Oliver et al. 2000).
In addition, the ozonation process was found to be more efficient in the removal of color
compared to removal of COD. This can be explained from the chemical characteristics
of the azo-linkage of the dyes. The azo-linkage is the part easiest oxidized within the
molecular structure of the dyestuffs, and therefore the transformation of the azo-linkage
leading to decolorization, is the preferred reaction. In these cases, the decolorization
does not mean the degradation or mineralization of organic dye molecules. Thus, the
COD is reduced insignificantly even at a complete decolorization of textile wastewaters
(Oliver et al. 2000). The experiments also show that the oxidation process did not 115 Vat dyes (blue color wastewater)

BOD after the ozonation treatment. Fenton process for treating four wastewater streams Optimal pH The optimal pH for color removal with Fenton’s reagent was determined by varying the
pH of the wastewater in the range between pH 2 and 5. Figure 3.31 (a), (b), (c), and (d)
show the effect of pH on color intensity and color removal efficiency for four
wastewaters. The H2O2 and Fe2+ dosages differed per wastewater. The applied dosages
of H2O2 and Fe2+ were calculated from the concentration of dyestuff in wastewaters. For
disperse & reactive dyes and mixed wastewater the maximum color removal efficiency
was obtained at pH 3 as shown in Figure 3.31 (a) and (d). For vat dyes and disperse &
acid dyes wastewater the highest color removal efficiency was obtained at pH 4 (figure
3.31 (b), and (c)). These results are in agreement with results found in literature
(Solozhenko et al. 1995; Kang and Hwang 2000). The Fenton process usually occurs in
an acid environment at a pH <5. Figure 3.32 shows the electric conductivity (EC) as a
function of pH in experiments with Fenton’s reagent of disperse and reactive dyes, and
vat dyes wastewater. The EC of all samples increased with an increasing dosage of
H2SO4 used for the pH adjustments of the wastewaters. The EC was the highest at pH 2
due to the large amount of used H2SO4. The increase of the EC at pH 2 was twice as
high compared to the increase of EC at pH of 3, 4, and 5. (a) Dosage of 133 mg H2O2/L and 20 mg Fe2+/L (b)  Dosage of 133 mg H2O2/L and 60 mg Fe2+/L 116 Disperse & reactive dyes wastewater

Optimal amount of H2O2
The determination of the optimal H2O2 dosage in the application of Fenton’s reagent
was performed at optimal pH. In Figure 3.33 (a), (b), (c) and (d) the effects of H2O2
dosage on the color intensity and color removal efficiency for four wastewater streams
is shown. From these figures it is clear that the H2O2 dosage reaches a critical point with
maximum color and turbidity removal efficiency. Increasing this critical dosage of H2O2
did hardly change the efficiencies. Figure 3.33(b) shows that for vat dyes wastewater a
color removal efficiency of 94% was obtained at a dosage of 33 mg H2O2/L, the
remaining color was 85 Pt-Co. The maximum efficiency found for this wastewater was
96%: the remaining color was 50 Pt-Co which meets the color discharge standard of
Vietnam. The disperse & reactive dyes wastewater needed a fivefold dosage of
H2O2(167 mg H2O2/L) compared with vat dyes wastewater to achieve the same color
removal efficiency of 94% (Figure 3.33 a). The mixed wastewater shows a similar
pattern as the vat dyes wastewater, but to achieve a high removal efficiency a high
dosage of 200 mg H2O2/L was necessary. At this dosage of 200 mg H2O2/L the color
removal efficiency is 85% and it hardly changes at further increase of the H2O2 dosage
from 400 to 1,500 mg H2O2/L. Disperse & acid dyes wastewater required a very large 117 Disperse & reactive dyes

dosage of H2O2 (2,640 mg/L) to reduce the color intensity from 3,100 to 735 Pt-Co,
corresponding with a color removal efficiency of 76%. The color removal efficiency
hardly improved at further increase of the H2O2 dose to 2,900 mg H2O2/L. The
explanation might be that oxidation by hydroxide radicals is in general less selective
than the oxidation by molecular ozone for the color removal of dyestuffs. The disperse
& acid dyes wastewater contains a variety of organic compounds from dyeing process
and finishing including dyestuffs and other compounds which cause a high COD
concentration and color intensity in the effluent. In reaction with Fenton’s, the reagent
amount of formed hydroxide radicals is not sufficient to oxidize most of the compounds
in the wastewater and the hydroxide radicals can not selectively oxidize dyestuffs. The
result is that a high color intensity remained after oxidation process.
At the end of the experiments, executed at optimal conditions, the residual H2O2 was
determined for each wastewater stream.  The residual H2O2 was 11.9 mg/L for the
disperse & reactive dyes wastewater, 11.1 mg/L for the vat dyes wastewater, 25 mg/L
for the disperse & acid dyes wastewater, and 0.01 mg/L for the mixed wastewater. In brief, when the H2O2 dosage has achieved a critical concentration, further increasing
of the H2O2 dosage hardly affects the efficiency. The results demonstrate that the type
of used dyestuffs in the wastewater plays a crucial role in the consumption of H2O2. (a) pH 3 and 20 mg Fe2+/L dosage (b) pH 4 and 60 mg Fe2+/L dosage (c) pH 4 and 325 mg Fe2+/L dosage (d) pH 3 and 222 mg Fe2+/L dosage

dosage. Figure 3.34 (a), (b), (c) and (d) shows the effect of Fe2+ dosage on the color
intensity and color removal efficiency of the four wastewater streams. Results of the
disperse & reactive dyes wastewater are presented in Figure 3.34 (a). Increasing the
ferrous dosage from 7.6 to 20 mg Fe2+/L decreased the color and turbidity, and achieved
a maximum color removal efficiency of 94% at 20 mg Fe2+/L (color intensity 75 Pt-Co).
The color increased slightly as the ferrous dose was increased further, because the
excess of Fe2+ can increase the color intensity. For vat dye wastewater (Figure 3.34 (b))
increasing the ferrous dosage decreased the color intensity and turbidity also: a color
removal efficiency of 95% was obtained at 60 mg Fe2+/L (70 Pt-Co). The maximum
color removal efficiency was 98% (45 Pt-Co). For the disperse & acid dyes wastewater
increasing ferrous dosage also enhanced the color and turbidity removal efficiency
(Figure 3.34 (c)). In order to reduce the color intensity from 3,100 to 595 Pt-Co, being
the highest efficiency (81%) for this wastewater, a ferrous dosage of 350 mg Fe2+/L was
used. Although achieved color removal efficiency was very high at 81 %, the color
intensity was still far away from meeting the discharge standard for color (50 Pt-Co).
For mixed wastewater the color intensity decreased slightly at an iron dosage of 40 mg
Fe2+/L due to the formation of fine flocs. These flocs caused increase of color, as
increasing the ferrous dosage from 80-111 mg Fe2+/L the color intensity decreased and
achieved a maximum color removal efficiency of 84% (145 Pt-Co at a dosage of 111
mg Fe2+/L). Increasing the ferrous dosage further did enhance the color removal
efficiency but not much: the color removal efficiency was 90% (145 Pt-Co) at a dosage
of 141 mg Fe2+/L. The experiments show that the ferrous dosage affects decolorization. When the ferrous dosage reaches a critical level further increase has hardly any effect
on the color removal efficiency. The EC of disperse & reactive dyes and vat dyes
wastewater increased with increasing ferrous dosage as can be seen from Figure 3.35.
This was also the case for mixed wastewater. (a) pH 3 and 167 mg H2O2/L dosage (b) pH 4 and 167 mg H2O2 /L dosage

COD removal efficiency of 52%: the COD decreased from 4060 to 1967 mg O2 /L, at a
large dosage H2O2 and Fe2+. The residual iron concentration was analyzed after each experiment for three
wastewater streams at optimal conditions. The total residual iron concentration was 0.35
for vat dyes, 0.91 for disperse & reactive dyes, and 4.69mg Fetotal /L  for mixed
wastewater in which Fe3+ made up more than 50% of the total iron. These result shows
that if optimal conditions are applied, an additional removal step for residual iron is not
necessary because the iron concentration was under the Vietnamese discharge standard
for total iron (5 mg Fe/L). 120 0

Fenton's reagent Comparing the effectiveness of Fenton’s reagent and coagulation with FeSO4 on the
removal efficiencies, the Fenton’s reagent proved to be better in terms of color and
COD removal for the four wastewater streams. The reason is that the reaction of
Fenton’s reagent induces simultaneous both processes: the oxidation process with the
formation of hydroxyl radicals and the coagulation process with the formed Fe(OH)3. Table 3.7 shows for the three types of investigated wastewaters the results of the final
color intensity and COD after treatment with the Fenton’s reagent and after the
coagulation process with FeSO4 . Table 3.7: A comparison of removal efficiencies of the Fenton’s reagent process

5,000 Comparison of the color removal efficiencies of the Fenton’s reagent process and the
ozone oxidation process for the different wastewaters is shown in Figure 3.36. It shows
that the Fenton’s reagent process gives a better efficiency. This can be explained by the
mechanism of the Fenton’s reaction. Both the oxidation and coagulation process occur
simultaneously using Fenton’s reagent. The effect is that colloidal particles can be
removed by the coagulation process. In the ozone oxidation process no specific
mechanisms is induced for the removal of colloidal particles present in mixed
wastewater, vat dyes wastewater, and acid dyes wastewater. The result is a low removal
efficiency. Figure 3.36: The color removal efficiency (E%) of the Fenton’s reagent and ozone

Color (Pt-Co) Temperature effect on the Fenton’s reagent process To determine the effect of temperature on the performance of the Fenton’s reagent
process, disperse & reactive dyes and vat dyes wastewater were investigated. Three
temperatures were investigated: 30, 40 and 600C. The results are shown in Figure
3.37(a) and (b). With both wastewater streams the optimal temperature at which the
removal efficiency of color was the highest was 400C. The remaining color of disperse
& reactive dyes wastewater was 25 Pt-Co at 400C. The color intensity increased to 435
at 600C. Similar results were obtained for the vat dyes wastewater. The remaining color
at 400C was 12 Pt-Co. The color intensity increased to 159 Pt-Co at 600C. The
explanation is that with increasing temperature from 300C to 400C the reaction rate can
increase. The H2O2 almost completely reacted to form hydroxyl radicals and no residual
H2O2 was detected after the reaction at 400C and 600C. The experiment at 300C showed
a residual H2O2 concentration of 11.9 mg H2O2/L. When the temperature was increased
to 600C a part of the H2O2 can decompose to O2 and H2O, causing a H2O2 deficit,
resulting in a lower formation of hydroxyl radicals as well as in an higher remaining
iron concentration in comparison with the experiments at a temperature of 300C and
400C. These experiments demonstrated that the temperature can affect the color removal
efficiency when applying Fenton’s reagent. However, these results are not in agreement
with literature. According to Sevimli and Kinaci (2002), the effects of temperature on
the oxidation by Fenton’s reagent was very limited and the color removal efficiency did
not change significantly. (a) Disperse & reactive dyes wastewater (b) Vat dyes wastewater
Figure 3.37 (a) and (b): The effects of temperature on final color intensity at
application of the Fenton’s process for two types of wastewaters 3.4.4 Conclusions The AOPs can be a feasibility solution to the problem of decolorizing textile
wastewaters. The results obtained from studies with O3, O3/H2O2, and Fenton’s reagent
proved that when wastewaters contained a relatively high color concentration (such as
disperse & reactive dyes, vat dyes, disperse & acid dyes, acid dyes, and mixed
wastewater), the application of the Fenton’s reagent process as a pretreatment step was
better than the O3 or O3/H2O2 process in terms of color removal and especially in terms
of COD removal. With the application of Fenton‘s reagent, the coagulation and 122 oxidation process occur simultaneously. Therefore Fenton’s reagent seems quite
effective for the treatment of soluble and insoluble dyestuffs used in the textile industry.
The achieved efficiencies were high for color and COD removal, except for the acid
dyes wastewater which had a low COD removal efficiency. These experiments
confirmed that with the application of the Fenton’s reagent process, the strict standards
of color and COD (Color: 50 Pt-Co and COD: 80 mg O2/L) for wastewaters
contaminated with dyestuffs such as vat dyes, and disperse & reactive dyes and for
mixed wastewaters can be met. In this study it was also found that in practice the Fenton’s reagent process is
economically not feasible when applied as a pre-treatment step for textile wastewaters
with a high COD concentration. This was the case with the acid dyes wastewater (COD:
6,380 mg O2/L) and disperse & acid dyes wastewater (COD: 4,060 mg O2/L). The
treatment process is economically unfeasible due to the considerable amount of H2O2
and Fe2+ necessary to decolorize these wastewaters. Disadvantage of the use of Fenton’s
reagent are the large amount of sludge which is generated. However, the quantity of
sludge produced from the Fenton’s process was less compared to the coagulation
process. For example, the amount sludge generated with Fenton’s reagent was about 27
ml (after 30 minutes settling) per liter of wastewater and 230 ml/L with the coagulation
process with FeSO4 for the vat dyes wastewater. In addition, wastewater treated with
Fenton’s reagent (pH is about from 3 to 5) needs pH adjustment before discharge into
the environment or before a next treatment process is applied. Another disadvantage is
that the remaining soluble iron after the Fenton’s reagent reaction needs also to be
removed to meet the Vietnamese discharge standards. These disadvantages related to
the use of Fenton’s reagent can be reduced by maintaining optimum dosages to
minimize consumption of chemicals by an automatic control system. The effects of salts concentration (NaCl and Na2CO3) on the ozone process found in this
study were similar to those in literature, as mentioned by Hoigne’ (1998), Tanaka
(2002), Boncz (2002). A high concentration of these salts did not affect the
decolorization of artificial wastewater or the ozone dosage needed. However, in
literature the effect of colloidal particles (suspended solids) on AOPs, especially in the
ozone process, has not been considered yet. From literature, it can be observed that
insoluble dyes such as vat dye, disperse, and sulphur dye could not be removed
efficiently by application of ozone. In general the literature hardly mentions the effect of
particles on AOPs. The results of the experimental work show that colloidal particles in
wastewater (lubic-Co) in artificial and vat dyes wastewater) affected significantly the
consumption of ozone and extended the retention time for reaction. Thus the ozone
process efficiency is highly sensitive to wastewaters containing a large amount of
particles. The experiment with insoluble vat dyes wastewater demonstrates this clearly.
This wastewater showed the highest removal efficiency with the Fenton’s reagent
process and showed the lowest removal efficiency with the ozone process. The results
also show that the decolorization of textile wastewater with the ozonation process was
related to the pH. Under acidic conditions direct oxidation by O3 takes place and the
decolorization occurs because the chromophore bond of the dyestuffs is broken by
attack of the O3 molecule. For instance, filtered disperse & acid dyes with an original
pH of 5.9 achieved the highest efficiency at the same ozone dose of 200 mg O3/L in
comparison with other filtered dyestuffs wastewaters at alkaline conditions (disperse & 123 reactive dyes at pH 8.6 and vat dyes wastewater at pH 11). The results showed that the
ozonation process had less effect on COD decrease. The COD removal efficiencies
were in the range of 5-17%. Similar results were found in literature. The advantages of the ozone process are that the ozone process did not require any
additional chemicals for pH adjustment. Also the electric conductivity hardly changed
with the ozone process and there was no sludge formation. As mentioned in chapter 2,
the amendment of hydrogen peroxide to the ozonation process may improve mass
transfer of the ozone in the liquid phase by an increase of the hydroxyl radicals amount,
resulting in an increased decolorization efficiency. However, the experiments indicated
that the radical reactions were not effectively promoted by the addition of hydrogen
peroxide at high pH (11). In fact the efficiency decreased with the addition of hydrogen
peroxide. Hence an optimal ratio of H2O2:O3 exists depending on the composition of the
wastewater, which has to be determined in practice for each type wastewater. The
experiments described in this chapter showed that temperature affects the efficiency of
color removal for AOPs. This is in contrast with literature data. Galindo and Klat (1998)
and Masschelein (2002) reported no effect of temperature on the decolorization by
AOPs treating textile wastewaters. The experimental work on the effect of temperature
in AOPs showed that the Fenton’s reagent had the highest color removal efficiency at
400C. Textile wastewater usually has a high temperature (40-500C), thus application of
the Fenton’s reagent process as pretreatment step at high temperature is a suitable
method, since the wastewater cooling step is unnecessary. 3.5. Costs
The selection of a wastewater treatment process has also to be assessed from an
economical point view. Figure 3.38 shows the operational fees of the studied methods. For disperse & reactive dyes wastewater (Figure 3.38 (a)) the Fenton’s reagent was the
most optimal treatment method in terms of costs: 0.2 USD/m3. These costs only include
chemicals and energy. The Fenton’s reagent was also the most optimal treatment in
terms of high color and COD removal efficiency (color intensity in effluent: 75 Pt-Co,
COD in effluent: 40 mg O2/L). The coagulation process also showed a good costs result
(0.2-0.3 USD/m3), however, the color removal efficiency was only 76-79%. In addition,
a large amount of sludge was generated with the coagulation process, which will
increase the operational costs due to handing and treating the sludge (147 USD/ton
sludge). The ozone process has operational costs which are 2.5 times higher compared
to the costs of the Fenton’s reagent process, and it showed also a lower color removal
efficiency. For the vat dyes wastewater the Fenton’s reagent also was the cheapest option. The
estimated costs were 0.2 USD/m3 for a very high removal efficiency of 98% for color
and 90% for COD. These two parameters met the Vietnamese discharge standards. The
coagulation process of vat dyes wastewater achieved a color and COD removal of 95-
96% with operational costs in the range of 0.4-0.5 USD/m3. The disperse & acid dyes wastewater which had a high color intensity and a high COD
required substantial amounts of chemicals and showed a high energy consumption for
all studied treatment methods. This resulted in operational costs of 0.5-0.7 USD/m3 for
the coagulation process and 1.7 USD/m3 for treatment with Fenton’s reagent, and 1.8 124 Disperse & reactive dyes watewater

USD/m3 for the ozone process. Although the removal efficiencies with ozone, Fenton’s
reagent, and the coagulation process were high (ozone: 79%, coagulation: 68-81% (used
three coagulants), Fenton: 83%), the color was far from meeting the discharge
standards. For treating the mixed wastewater the coagulation process with aluminum sulfate was
the best option in terms of costs: 0.2 USD/m3, with a high removal efficiency of 95%
for color and 81% for COD. The same result of color removal efficiency was obtained
with Fenton’s reagent, but the 88% COD removal efficiency by the Fenton’s reagent
process was in general higher than with the coagulation or the ozonation process.
Estimated costs are 0.5 USD/m3 for application of Fenton’s reagent. Since the mixed
wastewater was comprised of many types of wastewater streams from the
manufacturing process and diluted it was easier to treat and needed fewer chemicals. Figure 3.38: Comparison of treatment methods regarding costs of the coagulation
processes and AOPs of four wastewaters
3.6. General conclusions of physical/chemical processes
The results of pH change, application of a coagulation step or application of AOPs for
the four wastewater streams investigated are summarized in Figure 3.39. The Fenton’s
reagent is the most effective method for color removal of the four types of wastewater
(disperse & reactive dyes, vat dyes, disperse & acid dyes, and mixed wastewater),
especially for the vat dyes wastewater. The application of Fenton’s reagent at the
elevated temperatures of textile wastewater is a promising method for treatment of the
main dyestuffs used in the textile industry such as vat, disperse, reactive, and acid dyes. 125 The Fenton’s reagent method is not economically effective with wastewater streams
with a very high COD concentration. Thus, applying separate collection of different
wastewater streams will result in a higher economic efficiency because biodegradable
compounds present in wastewater can be treated separately by a biological technology.
This biological technology does not require addition of chemicals like Fenton’s reagent,
therefore the operational costs might be lower. Some conclusions can be drawn for the coagulation process for the four types of
wastewater streams. The experimental results show that the coagulation process yields
high color removal efficiencies. Among the three studied coagulants, aluminum sulfate
was the most effective with respect to color removal of the four types of wastewaters.
The aluminum sulfate seems a promising coagulant in terms of costs and availability.
The insoluble vat and disperse dyes can be completely removed by the coagulation
process or by Fenton’s reagent. Both the coagulation process and Fenton’s reagent
proved to be more efficient in removal of color and COD for the textile wastewater
containing a mixture of soluble and insoluble dyes. The results also revealed that a part
of the soluble dyes can also be removed by the coagulation process due to adsorption in
flocs. Change of only the pH did not cause a destruction of color of dyestuffs. However, the
application of pH change is significantly affecting the performance of the coagulation
processes and AOPs. There are some differences between literature and this study regarding the results of
ozone treatment. As mentioned in chapter 2 in literature the difference of the color
removal efficiencies in a low and high pH environment was limited for the ozone
process. However, from our results it is clear that the direct oxidation by molecular
ozone is much more selective than the oxidation by hydroxyl radicals. For instance,
with a filtered sample of disperse & acid dyes wastewater with an original pH of 5.9 the
highest removal efficiency was achieved at the same ozone dose (200 mg O3/L)
compared to disperse & reactive dyes at pH 8.6 and vat dyes wastewater at pH 11. The study also showed that particles (colloidal particles or suspended solids) affect
negatively the ozone process with respect to the required dosage of chemicals and the
required treatment time. The ozone process has almost no removal effect for vat dyes
wastewater. This study revealed that the ozone process as a pre-treatment step is not suitable for insoluble dyes wastewater streams. If the wastewater contains a high
concentration of suspended solids or colloid particles, a filtration or coagulation step has
to be applied before applying the ozone process. The ozone process can be applied to
treat insoluble dyes such as disperse dyes and vat dyes. However, this will consume a
large amount of ozone, because ozone will oxidize insoluble dyes to soluble ones, and
then break the chroromphore bonds. The ozonation process as the first step for
decolorizing or enhancing biodegradability of raw textile wastewater is therefore not
effective. 126 Disperse & reactive dyes wastewater

The textile industry generates a large volume of wastewater with complex composition.
Various organic compounds (sizing and desizing agents), surfactants, bleaching
chemicals, different dyestuffs, salts, and many other chemicals can be found in textile
wastewater. Difficulties with the treatment of textile wastewater mostly arise with the
simultaneous presence of all these compounds in the wastewater. Results of the
experimental research (chapter 3) show that physical/chemical processes like pH
variation, coagulation, and AOPs, for treatment of textile wastewater have limited
success as an individual treatment process. Each of these processes could only remove
one or a few types of pollutants from the wastewater with the consequence that the
effluents could not meet all the discharge regulations for discharge on surface water.
The research also proved that chemical coagulation as a pre-treatment step and an
effective process for high strength raw textile wastewaters. The economic feasibility of
each process, however, was limited as a result of the relatively high costs of these
processes, as was the case when AOPs were applied to achieve complete wastewater
COD oxidation. It was also clear from the experiments in chapter 3, that it is better to
apply AOPs, especially the ozone process, as a final treatment process or following
chemical coagulation. A survey of over 50 wastewater treatment facilities of textile enterprises in Vietnam
shows that in practice only one coagulation step or coagulation in combination with a
biological process (activated sludge process) is usually applied as treatment. However,
almost none of the produced effluents could meet Vietnamese standards for industrial
wastewater discharge (TCVN 5945:2005) for the parameters color and COD. According
to
Kao
et
al
(2001)
wastewater
treatment
technology
(biological
and
coagulation/flocculation technologies) of 75 textile wastewater treatment facilities in
Taiwan currently failed to effectively remove color from wastewater. Almost all these
textile enterprises need to install a post treatment like AOPs for a complete color
removal. Vandevivere et al. (1998) observed that the coagulation process is wide spread
and an effectively process for color removal in textile wastewater. A combination of
coagulation and biological processes can sometimes meet the discharge standards.
Vandevivere et al. (1998) mentioned that ozone can decolorize most dyestuffs, but is
less efficient with non-soluble dyestuffs and high strength raw textile wastewater.
Nowadays (chapter 2), the aerobic process is widely used for the removal of COD and a
part of the color of textile wastewater. Other technologies such as adsorption, reverse osmosis, electrochemical treatment are
researched on laboratory and pilot scale for textile wastewater treatment. Nevertheless,
practical applications of these technologies are limited. From literature it can concluded
that textile wastewater treatment currently has problems meeting effluent discharge
regulations or to produce effluent fit for reuse at feasible costs. Therefore it is necessary
to study an optimal post treatment for application after the coagulation and/or aerobic
process. To achieve this aim, six process combinations were studied: (1) coagulation and
Fenton’s reagent; (2) coagulation and ozone; (3) activated sludge and coagulation; (4)
activated sludge and ozone/hydroxide peroxide; (5) activated sludge and Fenton’s 129 reagent; (6) activated sludge, coagulation and ozone. From the results of the
experimental research, an optimal scheme for textile wastewater treatment technology
will be selected based on the technical performance and costs.
4.2 Materials and methods 4.2.1 Equipment
Jar test apparatus
A jar test apparatus, model JLT6 (Velp Scientifiza) was used in the coagulation and
Fenton‘s reagent experiments, to determine: -
Optimal pH; -
Optimal dosage of coagulant; -
Optimal dosage of H2O2; -
Optimal dosage of Fe2+.
The specifications of the jar test apparatus are described in the chapter 3, section 3.2.2
(coagulation experiments). Ozone reactor In this experiment, the same reactor system was used as in the ozone experiments
described in chapter 3, section 3.3.2. The ozone reactor is presented in Figure 3.12. The
ozone was generated from dried air with an ozone generator: model Dozomax, with a
flow rate of 11.7 L/hr. The capacity of the ozone generator was 1g O3/hour.
Aerobic reactor
Total volume of reactor was 5 liters; the working volume of the reactor was 3.5 L. The
reactor was made of glass. In the activated sludge reactor air was supplied by an air
pump (model Resun, made in China) with a capacity of 60 L/min. The air was fed to the
reactor through an air diffuser system (pumice stone) installed at the bottom of the
reactor. The activated sludge batch reactor is illustrated in Figure 4.1. Figure 4.1: Activated sludge batch reactor set-up 130 4.2.2 Chemicals -
From the results in chapter 3, aluminum sulfate Al2(SO4 )3.18H2O was found the
most effective coagulant for color removal, therefore it was also used in the
experiments described in this chapter. -
H2O2 30%  solution and ferrous sulfate FeSO4.7H2O were used in Fenton’s reagent and
the ozone/ H2O2 experiments; -
Na2S2O3 and KI were used in the determination of the ozone concentration;
-
pH adjustments were made with H2SO4 or NaOH solutions which were prepared
from concentrated acid (H2SO4 95-98%) or NaOH (98%) with demineralized
water to obtain the desired 5-10% concentration. The H2O2 30%, FeSO4.7H2O, Na2S2O3 and KI were from Merck. H2SO4 (95-98%),
NaOH (98%) were pure grade and from Guangdong Guanghua chemical factory Co., Ltd,
China. The Al2(SO4)3.18H2O was from Tan Binh chemical company in Vietnam. 4.2.3 Analytical methods All analytical methods used for the experiments are described in chapter 3 section 3.3.2;
with the exception that of the residual hydrogen peroxide and ozone were determined by
the iodometric titration method. 4.2.4 Wastewater In this study, all experiments were performed with real textile wastewater which was
obtained from the 28 Company-Agtex located in the GoVap district, Hochiminh City,
Vietnam. The scheme of the production process applied in this company together with
the used chemicals and dyestuffs is described in section 5.5.2 (chapter 5). The samples
were collected from the equalization tank of the wastewater treatment facility. The
samples were stored at 40C. Table 4.1 presents the composition of the mixed
wastewater. The main characteristics of the wastewater are a high pH, high color
intensity, and high levels of COD and BOD. Table 4.1: The composition of mixed wastewater

equipment holds 6 beakers and each beaker contained 500 ml of wastewater. After the
jar test mixer was turned on, the dosages of coagulant and pH adjustments solutions
(H2SO4) were added to the wastewater at a same time. Based on literature information
and practice, instantaneous rapid mixing of metal salts is one important criterion.
Typical mixing times for coagulation of colloidal particles are less than 1 minute and
sweep floc precipitation is in range of 1-10 minutes (Metcalf and Eddy 2003). Therefore
complete mixture of chemicals and wastewater was carried out with a rapid mixing
velocity 100 rpm for 1 min. Then the mixing velocity was decreased to 30-40 rpm (slow
mixing) and continued stirring for 30 minutes. After the mixing steps the formed flocs
were left to settle for 30 minutes before samples of the supernatant were collected for
determination of pH, color, turbidity, and COD. Time period of the assay was about 60
minutes. The experiments were performed in the same fashion as described in chapter 3 section
3.2.2. Each experiment included two steps: - The first step was to determine the optimal pH value. The pH values tested were
4, 5, and 6 at a constant dosage of 400 mg Al2(SO4)3.18H2O/L;
- The second step was to determine the optimal Al2(SO4)3.18H2O dosage. The
aluminum dosages tested were 200, 400, 800, 1,200, and 1,600 mg/L at the
optimal pH determined previously. Fenton’s reagent process
The set-up of the experiments was the same as for the coagulation experiments. The
used volume of wastewater was 500 ml. The H2O2 and the H2SO4 for pH adjustments
were added to the wastewater at the same time. The pH was adjusted from 2 to 5. After
the additions rapid-mixing for one minute at 100 rpm was followed by 60 minutes slow
mixing at 30 rpm to the complete reaction. At the end of the reaction, the samples were
left to settle for 45 minutes before samples of the supernatant were collected for
determination of pH, color, turbidity, and COD. The experiments were: - To determine the optimal pH. The values of pH were varied from 2 to 5 with 10%
H2SO4, at a H2O2 dosage of 265 mg/L and 23 mg Fe2+/L. The pH that provided
the best color and COD removal efficiencies was considered optimal. - At the optimal pH value, the H2O2 dosage was varied: 265, 400, 530 mg/L, at a
constant dosage of 23 mg Fe2+/L. The H2O2 dosage that provided the best color
and COD removal efficiencies was considered optimal.
- At the optimal pH and H2O2 dosage, the Fe2+ dosage was varied: 8, 16, 24, 32
mg/L. The Fe2+dosage that provided the best color and COD removal efficiencies
were considered optimal. 132 Ozone process Three experiments were performed with the ozone process. Firstly, with the
combination of coagulation and ozone treatment, one liter of coagulated (settled)
wastewater was used. In this experiment, two pH values (5 and 8) were studied at the
same ozone dosage of 67.3 mg O3/L. Secondly, with the combination of activated
sludge and O3 and O3/H2O2 treatment, one liter of activated sludge effluent was filtered
before it was put into the O3 reactor. Different ozone dosages were studied, varying
from 30 to 600 mg/L at pH 7.9 (pH of activated sludge effluent). Finally, with the
combination of activated sludge, coagulation and ozone treatment, one liter of
coagulated wastewater was studied with varying ozone dosages of 0 mg O3/L up to 80
mg O3/L at pH 5. During the ozone reaction, samples were collected at the regular time
intervals of 5, 30, 40, 50, 60, 120 minutes or samples were collected after complete
decolorization was obtained. The samples were left to settle for 30 minutes and the
supernatant was used for the determination of pH, color, and turbidity. At the highest
color removal efficiency the COD of the settled sample was determined. The ozone
content of ingoing and outgoing sample of the ozone reactor was measured. The ozone
dosage that provided the best color removal efficiency was considered optimal. Aerobic process The aerobic biodegradability of the mixed wastewater was determined in batch
experiments. A volume of 3.5 L wastewater was used for each experiment. Air was
supplied by an air pump with a capacity of 60 L/min. During the experiment, the
dissolved oxygen concentration was kept at 2-3 mg O2 /L. The pH of the wastewater
was adjusted to 7.0-7.5 with 5% H2SO4. Textile wastewater usually has a low
concentration of nitrogen and phosphorous. Therefore the wastewater was supplemented
with nutrients such as NaHPO4 and NH4Cl in a ratio of COD:N:P = 150:5:1. Sludge
from an activated sludge tank treating textile wastewater in Vietnam was used as seed
sludge in the experiment. The sludge was fed to the reactor so that the suspended solids
(SS) concentration was 3,000-3,500 mg/L. After constant conditions were reached, the
reactor was sampled hourly for 10 hours. These samples were centrifuged for 3 minutes
at 4,000 rpm before pH, color, and COD were determined. The tested wastewater
treatment combinations are listed in table 4.2 with reference of the sections where the
results are discussed.

4.3 Combination of physical, chemical and biological processes 4.3.1 Combination of coagulation and Fenton’s reagent processes Coagulation/flocculation process Figure 4.2 shows the effect of pH on the color intensity and color removal efficiency in
the coagulation process. At pH 5, the best color removal efficiency of 92% was obtained
corresponding with remaining color intensity of 105 Pt-Co. Figure 4.2: Effect of pH on the color intensity and color removal efficiency
obtained in the coagulation process of mixed wastewater at an aluminum sulfate
dosage of 400 mg/L The effect of aluminum sulfate dosages on the color intensity and removal efficiency in
the coagulation process showed that an increase in dosage of coagulant resulted in a
decreased color intensity (Figure 4.3). At both dosages 400 and 800 mg/L of aluminum
sulfate the color removal efficiency was the same. The highest was 92% with a
remaining color of 105 Pt-Co. However, at an aluminum sulfate dosage of 400 mg/L,
the residual COD was the lowest (230 mg O2/L), which equals a COD removal
efficiency of 81%. As optimal aluminum sulfate dosage 400 mg/L was chosen.
Increasing the dosage up to 1,200 mg/L hardly changed the efficiency. 134 0

experiments confirm again that the coagulation process is indispensable as a treatment
for textile wastewater because it can significantly decrease COD and color.

11 Fenton’s reagent process applied as post treatment process after the coagulation
process Optimal pH The wastewater treated by the coagulation process was further post treated with
Fenton’s reagent. Determination of optimal pH for the Fenton’s reagent was carried out
by varying pH values between 3, 4 and 5. Figure 4.4 shows the effect of pH on the color
intensity and removal efficiency with Fenton’s reagent. The results show that applying
Fenton’s reagents the color intensity increased at all tested pH values. As a consequence 135 0

Fenton’s reagent after coagulation gave a negative efficiency in comparison with
original sample. The reason was that color-producing complex compounds were formed
by oxidation processes of hydroxyl radicals. The other reason was that oxidized
dissolved iron ions formed color-producing complex compounds. The color removal
was found to be more or less independent of the pH. Within the three tested pH values
pH 4 was considered the optimal pH which gave the lowest color intensity (150 Pt-Co).
This pH was selected to determine optimal dosage of H2O2 and Fe2+. Figure 4.4: Effect of pH on the color intensity and removal efficiency in the
Fenton’s reagent process treating coagulated mixed wastewater. Used dosages in
the Fenton’s reagent process: 265 mg H2O2/L and 23 mg Fe2+/L Optimal H2O2 dosage Figure 4.5 shows the effect of H2O2 dosage on the color intensity and removal
efficiency of coagulated mixed wastewater. The obtained results were the same as with
the optimal pH experiment: increasing the dosages of H2O2 from 130 to 530 mg/L the
color hardly decreased. At a H2O2 dosage of 400 mg/L the color intensity deteriorated
the least and was more or less the same as the sample before the H2O2 addition (105 Pt-
Co). Therefore this dosage was chosen to be applied in the experiment for determining
the optimal ferrous dosage. Figure 4.5: Effect of H2O2 dose on the color intensity and removal efficiency of

Optimal Fe 2+ dose In this experiment, the effect of ferrous (Fe2+) dosage was tested. From Figure 4.6 can
be seen that the optimal ferrous dosage was at 8 mg/L: the corresponding color intensity
was 74 Pt-Co (removal efficiency 30%). At higher ferrous dosages of 16, 24, and 32
mg/L, the color intensity increased. The explanation might be that ferrous in the sample
is oxidized by the H2O2 to form red rust which caused higher color intensity than in
samples with a low iron dosage. Another explanation can be that iron-organic complex
compounds are formed when ferrous is overdosed. Kang (1997) found similar results
and reported that the color removal efficiency increased with increasing ferrous doses
and after reaching a maximum efficiency at the optimal ferrous dosage, the color
removal efficiencies drop at higher ferrous doses. At the optimal ferrous dosage of 8
mg/L the residual total iron that remained in the filtered sample was 3.4 mg/L, of which
1.5 mg/L was Fe2+ and 1.9 mg/L was Fe3+ (56% Fe3+ and 44% Fe2+  of total iron). The
decrease of total iron concentration might be caused by the ferrous coagulation process
which might occur simultaneously during the oxidation process. Combining the results of all optimalization experiments with Fenton’s reagent for
treating coagulated mixed wastewater, it can be concluded that the optimal conditions of
Fenton’s reagent were at pH 4 with a H2O2 dosage of 396 mg/L and a Fe2+ dosage of 8
mg/L. The resulting remaining color intensity was then 75 Pt-Co and 150 mg O2/L for
COD. This means that after treatment with the Fenton’s reagent at optimal conditions,
the color and COD of the treated wastewater was still higher than the Vietnamese
standards for discharge industrial wastewater (TCVN 5945:2005, class B) for color
intensity: 50 Pt-Co and COD: 80 mg O2/L. Figure 4.6: Effect of iron dosage on color intensity and removal efficiency of
coagulated mixed wastewater at pH 4 and 396 mg H2O2/L The optimal conditions for the coagulation and Fenton’s reagent processes are
summarized in Table 4.4. The treatment of the raw mixed wastewater with the
coagulation process proved to be very effective for COD and color removal, achieving a
high removal efficiency of 92% for color and 81% for COD. However, the subsequent
post treatment with the Fenton’s reagent process yielded limited success probably due to
the formation of color producing complex compounds such as iron-organic complexes
and rust particles and a coloring of the wastewater due to dissolved iron. The 137 combination of coagulation and Fenton’s reagent processes treating raw mixed
wastewater could not reach the TCVN 5945:2005, class B for color and COD in the
effluent (color: 50 Pt-Co, COD: 80 mg O2/L), but it did meet the QCVN
13:2008/BTNMT, class B for color (150 Pt-Co, COD 150 mg O2/L). Table 4.4: The optimal conditions and combined results of the coagulation and

(coagulation/flocculation process). The supernatant of the settled effluent of the
coagulation process was used as influent for the ozone process. Ozone process
The supernatant of the coagulated wastewater was treated with the ozone process at pH
5 and 8.2. Table 4.5 summarizes the results. At pH 5.0 (pH after coagulation) a 25 minutes reaction time with ozone achieved a color
removal efficiency of 54% (remaining color 50 Pt-Co). The COD was reduced to 100
mg O2/L corresponding with a removal efficiency of 53%. The O3 consumed was 30.3
mg/L which was 50% of the initial O3 dosage of 67.3 mg/L. The pH decreased from 5.0
to 4.3 at the end of the experiment. At the same experimental conditions but now at pH 8.2 the results showed that the color
removal was lower than at pH of 5. The maximum efficiency was only 27%, the
remaining color was 75 Pt-Co. However, the COD removal reached the same efficiency
(53%) as at pH 5, but the consumed amount of O3 was higher than at pH 5.0 (41.6 mg
O3/L). After reaction with ozone the pH also decreased from 8.2 to 7.4 at the end of the
experiment. 138 Table 4.5: Results of treatment with ozone of coagulated mixed wastewater at

8 In the combined treatment of coagulation and ozone the coagulation step removed
almost all suspended solids and colloidal particles from the wastewater. Therefore the
effect of particles was eliminated for the ozone process. The results showed that
coagulated wastewater was completely decolorized in 25 minutes by the ozone process.
The color removal of coagulated wastewater by the ozone process was higher at pH 5
than at pH 8 at the same ozone dosage of 67.3 mg O3/L and the same reaction time. As
mentioned in chapter 2, the degradation of organic compounds by ozone can follow two
main pathways: direct oxidation by molecular ozone and indirect oxidation by means of
hydroxyl radicals. The obtained results demonstrated that direct oxidation at low pH of 5 by molecular
ozone was very effective towards the decolorization of dyestuffs compared to oxidation
with the hydroxyl radical formed at a high pH value of about 8. Oxidation by molecular
ozone is much more selective than oxidation by hydroxyl radicals for dyestuffs which
incorporate one or more double bonds or a specific region with a high π -electron
density. The conclusion is that a combination of coagulation and ozone can be applied for the
treatment of textile wastewater with mixed disperse, reactive, vat, and acid dyes to meet
QCVN 13:2008/BTNMT, class A and B for color (50Pt-Co and 150Pt-Co). This
combination gave better results than the combination of coagulation and Fenton’s
reagent for color removal. With the application of the ozone process as post-treatment
after a coagulation/flocculation process was better than as a pre-treatment step (see
chapter 3) with respect to the amount of ozone needed to reach the Vietnamese
environmental regulation for color. This can be attributed to the removal of particles
prior to ozonation. However, the COD after combined coagulation and ozonation
remains above the limit allowed according to TCVN  5945: 2005, class B and QCVN
13:2008/BTNMT, class A with a maximum threshold for COD of 80 mg O2/L (TCVN
5945:2005, class B) and 50mg O2/L(QCVN 13:2008/BTNMT, class A). It does
however meet the value given by QCVN 13:2008/BTNMT, class B with a maximum
threshold for COD of 150 mg O2/L. 139 4.3.3 Combination of biological, physical, and chemical processes for treatment of
mixed textile wastewater Biological processes are widely used for the treatment of textile wastewaters. The
biological process used in the textile industry of Vietnam as well as in the world is the
aerobic activated sludge process. As mentioned in literature (chapter 2), the aerobic
activated sludge process performs very well regarding BOD removal but is almost
ineffective regarding color removal. As can be seen from the composition of textile wastewater (Table 4.1) the BOD/COD
ratio was around 0.4, therefore a (aerobic) biological process can be applied as a pre-
treatment for the treatment of the mixed wastewater. The combination of activated
sludge and different post treatment processes were studied in order to select the best
combination with respect to color and COD removal in the treatment of textile
wastewater.
Combination of activated sludge and coagulation process
Activated sludge process
The treatment time was varied to study its influence on the COD and color removal.
Figure 4.7 shows the effect of the treatment time on the color intensity and COD of
mixed wastewater. Within 4 hours of activated sludge treatment the CODcentrifuged of the
wastewater decreased and after that remained more or less constant: the CODcentrifuged
decreased from 1,180 to 345 mg O2/L. This corresponds with a COD removal efficiency
of about 70-76%. According to Mattioli, 2002; Hu, 2001; Panswad, 2001; O’Neill,
1999; Altinbas and Jiang, 1994, the activated sludge process performed very well on
BOD removal but was almost ineffective in color removal. This does not correspond to
the experimental results found in this study. In order to reduce effect of turbidity,
influents and effluents were centrifuged before measuring the color. The color
decreased from 995 to 530 Pt-Co after 9 hours activated sludge treatment, the color
removal efficiency after 7 hours was 43% (565 Pt-Co) and 47% at 9 hours. The
explanation for these results might be that the color removal in the biological process
was mainly through adsorption on the sludge. It was noticed that the color of the sludge
changed to dark brown (the color of the wastewater). In addition, a part of the dyestuffs
could be degraded in the aerobic process by scission of the double bonds with the
consequence a reduction of the color intensity. The biological process is indispensable
in the treatment of textile wastewater to reduce the consumption of chemicals for the
subsequent coagulation or chemical oxidation processes, since the textile wastewater
contains biodegradable compounds. 140 0

Color Figure 4.7: Effect of activated sludge treatment time on the COD and color
intensity for mixed wastewater Combination of activated sludge and coagulation process The activated sludge effluent was settled for 30 minutes, and then the supernatant was
treated with the coagulation process. In chapter 3 many experiments are described with
the aim to determine the optimal pH and dosage of coagulant for the coagulation
process of textile wastewater. Aluminum sulfate was considered the best coagulant.
Figure 4.8 and 4.9 show the effect of pH and aluminum sulfate dosage on color intensity
and removal efficiency of the supernatant of 30 minutes settled coagulated effluent of
an activated sludge process. The best pH range for the coagulation process was between
4.0 and 5.0 and the optimal aluminum sulfate dosage was 400 mg/L. The achieved color
removal efficiency was 90% with a remaining color of 110 Pt-Co. The COD decreased
from 345 to 40 mg O2/L, corresponding to a removal efficiency of 88%.  Increasing the
aluminum sulfate dosage from 400 to 1,200 mg/L hardly changed or slightly increased
the color removal efficiency at an aluminum sulfate dosage of 1,600 mg/L. After the
coagulation process the color intensity and COD meet the discharge regulation QCVN
13:2008/BTNMT, class B, but the color intensity still needs treatment to reach the
allowable threshold of 50 Pt-Co for TCVN 5945: 2005, class B. 141 0

treatment did not yet achieve the discharge regulation class A regarding color. In the
following experiment the combination of activated sluge and an O3 process is tested.
The activated sludge effluent was filtered before treatment with ozone. In Figure 4.10 the effect of ozone dosages varying from 0 to 450 mg/L on color removal
of the effluent of the activated sludge process is shown. The color was reduced from
1,100 to 205 Pt-Co with a maximum efficiency of 82%. When the ozone dosage was
increased from 42 to 250 mg/L, the color removal efficiency increased. Increasing
ozone dosages between 250 and 374 mg/L the color hardly changed. At ozone dosages
of 42 and 84 mg/L the color intensity reduced fast, and between 125-374 mgO3/L the
color reduction was less. This was explained by the fact that the pH of the effluent of
activated sludge treatment is 7.8-7.9. 142 0

Under these alkaline conditions the ozone may dissociate leading to the formation of
hydroxyl radicals and then both molecular ozone and hydroxyl radicals are present
simultaneously in the solution. According to results of ozone experiments in section
3.3.4 of chapter 3, the molecular ozone is much more selective in the decolorization of
dyestuffs than the hydroxyl radicals. According to Boncz (2002), from a chemical point
of view the azo-linkage of dyestuffs is the easiest to oxidize. In this case, molecular
ozone was selected to oxidize the azo-linkage of the dyestuffs or the double bond in
dyestuffs resulting in color reduction of the wastewater which was faster in the first
stage of the ozone process. As known, oxidation by hydroxyl radicals is faster but less selective than oxidation by
molecular ozone. The hydroxyl radicals can react with organic compounds and create
organic radicals with high reactivity, and subsequently can be demineralized as
presented in equation 22 of chapter 2. In addition these hydroxyl radicals can also
oxidize inorganic compounds present in textile wastewater. It was observed that although the wastewater was filtered before ozonation, after
finishing the ozone oxidation experiment several particles appeared in the sample. This
caused an increase of ozone consumption without a decreased of the color. The pH changed slightly during the reaction with ozone. The pH was reduced from 7.9
to 7.5 as presented in Figure 4.11. The combination of the activated sludge and ozone
process did not result in an effluent that could meet the discharge standard for color and
COD. Figure 4.10: Effect of the ozone dose on the color intensity and removal efficiency

from mixed wastewater Combination of activated sludge and O3/H2O2 processes In order to improve the color removal efficiency, the O3/H2O2 process was applied to
filtered activated sludge effluent from mixed wastewater. The optimal ozone dosage
was chosen from the previous experiment (250 mg/L). According to literature
mentioned in chapter 2, a ratio of 1 H2O2 to 2O3 is more or less optimum, therefore a
H2O2 dosage of about 125 mg/L was used. Figure 4.12 shows the effect of O3/H2O2, and
the O3 processes on the color intensity. There is little difference between applying O3
and O3/H2O2 to the wastewater. For the O3/H2O2 process at an ozone dosage of 250
mg/L, the color removal was higher resulting in a remaining color of 205 Pt-Co and
corresponding to a color removal efficiency of 81%. However, the sample became
turbid and many particles appeared after finishing the experiment, similar to the
previous O3 experiment. During the reaction the pH hardly changed and remained at pH
7.7. According to theory (chapter 2), the O3/H2O2 process with the formation of
hydroxyl radicals (OH*) can improve the color and COD removal efficiency; however
this experiment showed different results. The efficiency did not change even at high
hydrogen peroxide additions (chapter 3, ozone experiments). The hydrogen peroxide
addition to the O3 process did not improve the oxidation of dyestuffs with respect to the
color and COD removal. Hydrogen peroxide is known as a scavenger of hydroxyl
radicals. The hydrogen peroxide excess can cause the opposite effect intended. It is
difficult to determine the optimal hydroxide peroxide dose in the O3/H2O2 process.
Therefore the O3/H2O2 combination is not considered a suitable system to apply in
textile wastewater treatment because of the lack of efficiency improvement. 144 0

Combination of activated sludge and Fenton’s reagent The settled effluent from mixed wastewater treated by the activated sludge process was
treated with Fenton’s reagent. Figure 4.13 shows the effect of pH on the Fenton’s
reagent process regarding color intensity and removal efficiency. The results clearly
demonstrate that the best pH for Fenton’s reagent is pH 3.0, which is in agreement with
the values found in literature (chapter 2). At optimal pH the color removal efficiency
was 78%, with a remaining color of 245 Pt-Co. The effect of H2O2 dosage is shown in
Figure 4.14. With H2O2 dosages of 462 and 528 mg/L the color removal efficiency was
81%, higher than at dosages of 198, 264, 330, 396, 594, and 660 mg/L. The remaining
color was about 205-210 Pt-Co. The optimal H2O2 dosage was 462 mg/L. This dosage
was used in the experiment for the determination of the optimal Fe2+ dose. Figure 4.15
presents the effect of the Fe2+ dose in Fenton’s reagent on the color intensity and
removal efficiency. The maximum color removal efficiency was 77% at a Fe2+ dosage
of 32 mg/L. Further increase of Fe2+ dosages increased the color removal efficiency, but
not much. Increasing the Fe2+ dosage from 30 to 36 mg/L resulted in a decrease on
removal efficiency from 77% to 71%. The reason was that the excess Fe2+ was oxidized
to ferric hydroxide which increased the color intensity of the wastewater. The optimal
conditions for Fenton’s reagent for treating the effluent from an activated sludge process
were pH 3, 462 mg H2O2/L and 32 mg Fe2+/L. The effluent of the combined activated
sludge and Fenton’s reagent process at these optimized conditions achieved a color
intensity of 255 Pt-Co and a COD of 260 mg O2/L. Thus this treatment combination
could still not produce effluents that met the discharge regulations. 145 0

Combination of activated sludge, coagulation and ozone process Because the effluent from the combined activated sludge process and coagulation
process did not meet the discharge regulations, an experiment was carried out in which
the combined activated sludge process and coagulation process was followed by a
treatment with ozone. The results found in chapter 2 and section 4.3.2 indicated that at
low pH (after coagulation the pH is about 5) molecular ozone dominates the color
removal of textile wastewater. The effect of ozone dosage on color intensity and
removal efficiency of settled activated sludge and coagulation effluent at pH 5 is shown
Figure 4.16. When the ozone dosages were increased the color and COD removal
efficiencies increased. With an ozone dosage of 62 mg/L the color removal efficiency
was the highest (72%). The remaining color of the effluent was 45 Pt-Co and the COD
was 30 mg O2/L. Table 4.6 summarizes the obtained results of the three combined processes treating
mixed wastewater. With optimal ozone dosage the effluent meet the discharge
regulation or might be reused in another process of the textile manufacturing process.
The results demonstrated that the ozone process was very effect as a post- treatment or
polishing step. Figure 4.16: Effects of ozone dosages on color intensity and removal efficiency of
settled activated sludge and coagulation process effluent from mixed wastewater

4.4. Costs The survey of many textile companies in Vietnam showed that the main problem with
the treatment of the textile wastewater is the operational costs. The estimated costs for
treating one cubic meter of textile wastewater with different processes are illustrated in
Figure 4.17, 4.18, and 4.19. The operational costs are comprised of labor, electricity, and chemicals based on
Vietnamese conditions. From the results is clear that a single treatment process would
not give an effluent that meets the discharge regulation or would be too expensive if set
to achieve the discharge regulation. The coagulation & ozone and the coagulation &
Fenton’s reagent processes can be applied to textile wastewater to meet QCVN
13:2008/BTNMT, class B. However, the combined coagulation & Fenton’s reagent
process would have higher operational costs as well as a lower efficiency than
coagulation & ozone. A comparison of a combination of coagulation & ozone processes (physical and
chemical processes) and a combination of the biological, coagulation, and ozone
processes (biological, physical, and chemical processes) in this study shows that the best
results were achieved using a combination of biological, physical, and chemical
processes. This treatment combination is capable to achieve a high degree of efficiency,
it meets the QCVN 13:2008/BTNMT, class A and B as well as TCVN 5945:2005, class
B. It allows the reuse/recycling wastewater and it has low operational costs. Figure 4.17: Operational costs and remaining color intensity and COD with the

From the results obtained several conclusions can be drawn. It is clear that a single
treatment processes would hardly meet the discharge regulation, or in order to meet the
discharge regulation a single treatment would be too expensive. The treatment of textile 149 wastewater with the combination of an activated sludge, coagulation, and ozone process
yielded the best color and COD removal efficiency at the lowest costs compared to all
other tested combinations. In this system the biological process as the first step was
designed to remove biodegradable compounds. This first step reduced the chemicals
consumption in the next processes. The coagulation process was the next step; this step
eliminated the effect of colloidal particles on the ozone process. The low pH of 5 helps
the ozone to selectively oxidize the azo-linkages of dyes leading to easier
decolorization. In Table 4.7 a comparative summarization is offered of all tested
treatment combinations regarding pH, COD, color intensity and turbidity. Of the treatment combinations of coagulation + Fenton’s reagent and coagulation +
ozone, the combination of coagulation + ozone gave a higher color removal efficiency
and the operational costs are three times lower than the combination of coagulation +
Fenton’s reagent (0.97 USD/m3). The most successful decolorization of the textile
wastewater was at low pH by the molecular ozone mechanism; the preferential reaction
for color removal in textile wastewater. Two schemes for textile wastewater treatment
are proposed and described in Figure 4.21 and 4.22. With application of the first scheme
(Figure 4.21) the effluent of textile wastewater industry can meet the discharge
regulations for discharging into surface waters which are used for potable water
production (QCVN 13:2008/BTNMT, class A). The second scheme (Figure 4.22) may
be applied when discharging effluent into surface waters which are not used for potable
water production (QCVN 13:2008/BTNMT, class B). In addition the second scheme is a
suitable solution for companies with limited area like the 28 Company-Agtex located in
Hochiminh City. With application of the first scheme, the effluent can be reused in other
processes of textile manufacturing or for the purpose of irrigation. The results proved
that a combination of physical and chemical processes is more expensive compared to
the combination of biological, physical, and chemical processes. Table 4.7: Comparison of parameters of the different applied treatment methods on raw mixed wastewater

In textile industry, wet processes usually generate a large volume of wastewater.
Volume and composition of the wastewater depend on the manufacturing process, type
of machines and characteristics of fiber or fabric (cotton, polyester, nylon, blended of
cotton/polyester, etc.). According to Boncz (2002) quantities and composition of the
textile wastewater vary widely and amounts range from 40 to 300 m3 per ton product.
The survey results of the textile industry in Vietnam showed that the volume of
wastewater that was discharged was in the range of 10 to 415 m3 per ton product (Loan
2004). In general, three quarters of the total water consumption is related to the washing
processes (Loan, 2004). After each scouring, dyeing, printing and finishing step many
rinsing sequences are required (Mattioli et al. 2002). As reported by Groves et al. (1978)
an average 60 to 90% of total water consumption in wet processes is for rinsing
purposes. Almost all wastewaters generated from washing steps show lower pollutant
concentrations (COD, BOD, nutrients) than water from other steps of the wet processes
(Loan 2005). The wet processes include three main steps: preparation, dyeing and
finishing. In the preparation step several organic substances, surfactants and inorganic
matter are used. Many different dyes, salts and auxiliary chemicals are used for the
dyeing step. Organic substances such as sizing, softeners and surfactants are applied in
the finishing step. The difficulties with the treatment of textile wastewater mostly arise
from the presence of all the components mentioned above, mixed in the wastewater
stream. In order to meet the requirements of environmental regulations, a combination
of several treatment processes should be applied. In a textile wastewater treatment
system all the pollutants have to pass through the whole system, although each
treatment step of the system is designed for removing only one category of compounds
of the wastewater. Therefore, the construction and operational costs of the textile
wastewater treatment system has become a financial burden for the textile companies.
For that reason a separation of wastewater streams is studied with the purpose to
achieve high treatment efficiency at lower costs and to avoid influences of undesirable
compounds in the different treatment processes. The aim of this study is to assess the
possibilities for wastewater separation in a textile company to facilitate reuse and reduce
chemical consumption as much as possible to promote sustainable development. 5.2 Methodology The methods utilized for this study are data collection, site surveys, observations and
sampling for analysis. The data collection was the first step in which primary data such
as the geographical and administrative location, the type of manufacturing processes
and environmental performance were gathered through visiting the 28 Company-Agtex.
This company was located in GoVap district, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The primary
data collection was done to identify the impacts of the company’s production processes
on environment and ability to reuse water. In order to understand the manufacturing
process in more detail “face to face” interviews and site surveys were done. The
secondary data give information about the local discharge standards and requirements
for reuse of water in the production process of the company. The second step was
sampling and measuring the quantity and quality of the wastewater from each step in the
wet processes of the 28 Company-Agtex. This step was performed to assess the ability
for wastewater source separation with reuse and/or treatment in the company. 155 5.3 Experimental procedures At each step of the batch and continuous dyeing processes, the amounts of all inputs
(water, chemicals and dyestuffs) used at the 28 Company-Agtex were recorded.
Outgoing samples were collected and analyzed in order to assess the quality of water
and wastewater for the implementation of separation of wastewater streams. The
analyzed parameters include temperature, pH, color intensity, turbidity, suspended
solids, CODtotal , CODdissolved  , SO4
2-, PO4
3-, NH4
+, and N-org.
5.4 Analytical methods All analytical methods used are described in chapter 3. The determinations of alkalinity,
suspended solids, SO4
2-, PO4
3-
, NH4
+
, N-org were performed according to the Standard
Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater (APHA 1995). 5.5 Results and discussion of the wastewater situation at the 28 Company-Agtex 5.5.1 Environmental performance of the 28 Company-Agtex The 28 Company-Agtex is a typical large scale state-owned company in Vietnam. The
production capacity of the company is 8,000,000 m2 of fabric/year (28 Company-Agtex,
2007). The main products are cotton, blended cotton and polyester (T/C) and blended
wool fabrics. With a complete production system ranging from yarn twisting to
weaving, dyeing, finishing, sewing and finished products, the company has a full set of
modern technology and equipment which include yarn machines, continuous dyeing
process (pad-stream machine), batch dyeing process (Jet machine), etc. The company
also pays attention to the environmental impact throughout the manufacturing process.
For this environmental commitment the enterprise received certificates of the
international standard organization, such as ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 14001:1996. In order
to qualify for the ISO 14001:1996 certificate, the enterprise invested in a wastewater
treatment system with a capacity of 700m3/day, with a combination of coagulation and
filtration processes as described in Figure 5.1. In this treatment system, chemical
coagulation was applied as the main process for effluents treatment, followed by a
filtration process as post treatment to polish the effluent. As mentioned earlier the
coagulation process alone can not meet the discharge standards, especially regarding
COD and color. Also the results from measuring effluent of wastewater treatment
facility of the 28 Company-Agtex demonstrated this (Table 5.1). The effluent did not
meet the discharge standards TCVN 5945:2005 class B as well as QCVN 13:2008, class
B with three parameters: the BOD was three times higher then the standard given in
TCVN 5945:2005 and regulation QCVN 13:2008; the COD was nearly eight times
higher than the standard given in TCVN 5945:2005 and five times higher than the
regulation given in QCVN 13:2008, also the pH exceeded the standards. Textile
wastewater usually contains a high concentration of auxiliary chemicals (organic
compounds) and remaining dyestuffs. However, the chemical coagulation/flocculation
process can only remove part of the organic matter. In spite of the high operational costs
the effluent can not meet the standards. When the operational costs of wastewater
treatment make up from 15-30% of the production costs the consequences are
problematic for the company (28 Company-Agtex, 2007). 156 Table 5.1: Composition of treated wastewater of the 28 Company-Agtex

The 28 Company-Agtex applies two main methods: batch and continuous operation.
Both methods produce an effluent containing similar chemical constituents, namely the
exhaust dye and other auxiliary chemicals. However, the concentration of exhaust dyes
in the effluent streams of the two methods can vary considerably. Details of each
method are described below. Batch dyeing process An example of a general batch dyeing process with generated wastewater streams is
described in Figure 5.2. In this process a high amount of organic waste (expressed as
COD) can be produced in the dyeing and finishing steps. The dyeing step is
characterized by a high specific water consumption, auxiliary chemicals, and dyestuffs
resulting in a relatively high volume of wastewater with a high color intensity, and poor
biodegradability. The effluent from the finishing step (sizing) can have a high COD
with a high level of biodegradable compounds but the effluent volume is low.
Therefore, only the dyeing process was selected for this study. Figure 5.3 shows in more
details the dyeing process of blended fabric code G.TW.538 L5 that is made of 35%
cotton and 65% polyester and dyed using disperse and acid dyes. This process includes
three stages listed below. -
The bleaching stage: this stage includes three steps: bleaching, neutralizing, and
washing. The purpose of the bleaching stage is to enhance the following dye
application and the luster and appearance of fabrics. -
The dyeing stage: the auxiliary chemicals and dyestuffs are added in the dyeing
batch. The dyeing process is carried out at ± 1200C and at a pressure of 3
atmospheres for 60 minutes. After dyeing, the pressure is decreased from 3 to 1
atmosphere, together with decreasing the temperature to 800C. Most of the water
is then discharged into the sewer system. -
The washing stage: the purpose of this stage is to remove the residual dyestuffs
and chemicals in the fabric. The washing stage consisted of cold washing, hot
washing with chemicals, and finally hot washing. Figure 5.3 also shows the sampling points at which remaining concentrations and
quantities of wastewater after each step are determined. In the dyeing process, the
auxiliary and neutralization chemicals and dyestuffs were prepared according to the
requirements of the color and type of fabric. A recipe of the dyeing process of the fabric
with code G.TW.538 L5 is summarized in Table 5.2. 159 Table 5.2: The recipe of dyeing process of fabric G.TW.538 L5

dyeing process wastewater is usually higher than the concentrations in the wastewater
from the continuous dyeing process. Table 5.3 shows the composition of wastewater streams from the batch dyeing process
for product G.TW.538 L5. The dyeing process was carried out with a Jet machine at
high pressure. The quantity of blended fabrics in each dyeing batch was 620 kg (about
1,605 m2) with a total water consumption of 52 m3. The wastewater after the dyeing
step (sample No. 4) has the highest concentration of pollutants, with a volume of about
5m3/batch. The color intensity exceeded 78 times and the COD about 64 times the
discharge standards. The low pH (4.6) of the wastewater was due to the requirements of
dyeing process with acid dyes. All the washing wastewater after the dyeing step
(samples 5 to 8) contained lower concentrations of pollutants compared to the
bleaching, neutralizing and dyeing wastewater. For example, the COD of samples 5 to 8
gradually decreased from 6,400 to 1,520, 1,320, 240, and 95 mg O2 /L, the color
intensity also decreased, from 3,950 to 825, 1,020, 615, 235 and 60 Pt-Co. The
bleaching and neutralizing steps produced high amounts of organic waste: 1,800 mg
O2/L after the bleaching step and 2,080 mg O2/L after the neutralize step. From the
recipe of dyeing process of the G.TW.538 L5 product it is clear that the organic wastes
produced in both these steps are highly biodegradable compounds. After the
neutralizing step the COD of the subsequent washing step (sample 3) decreased from
2,080 to 390 mg O2/L and the color intensity from 120 to 27 Pt-Co. The total volume of
wastewater generated from the dyeing process was about 47 m3 (90% of the total water
use) in which there was about 5 m3 (10%) that did not need treatment (sample 8), 5 m3
(10%) wastewater with a high pollution content in terms of color intensity and COD
which really did need treatment (sample 4), and 37 m3 (80%) with a low color intensity
and biodegradable COD (remaining samples). The wastewater with biodegradable COD
and low color intensity is can be pretreated with a biological process, which can result
in a decrease of operational costs. From the results in chapter 3, ozone proved to be
effective in the decolorization of high strength colored wastewater, generated from the
dyeing step with disperse and acid dyes. Figure 5.4 presents the operational costs and remaining color intensity after coagulation
and oxidation processes of wastewater containing disperse and acid dyes. Compared
with other treatment methods the ozone process was the best method regarding the
operational costs and remaining color intensity with disperse and acid dyes wastewater. 162 Disperse and acid dyes wastewater

process (aluminum and ferric sulfate) and advanced oxidation processes (Fenton’

700m3 about 200 m3 of wastewater originates from the batch dyeing process and the
remaining 500 m3
of wastewater is from the continuous dyeing process. According to
the collected data and measured flow rates, the volumes of each wastewater stream
originating from the batch dyeing process per day consist of: -
20 m3
of wastewater that can meet the discharge standards and/or can be reused in
another process of the production;
-
20 m3 of wastewater is characterized as high strength wastewater regarding color
intensity and COD, which have to specially treated (after dyeing step), -
160 m3 of wastewater consists of highly biodegradable wastewater streams. In order to assess the feasibility of two options, separated wastewater treatment and
treatment of all wastewater, mixed and diluted, the operational costs of both options
were estimated and are presented in Table 5.3. According to Table 5.3 the operational
costs of separated wastewater treatment are lower than that of treatment of mixed
wastewater streams. 163 Table 5.3: the estimated operational costs for treating separated wastewater

feasible because the operational costs will decrease. For the dyeing batch process, the
cost of separating wastewater can be decreased nearly 46% (approximately 29 US$ per
day or 8,700 US$ per year in comparison with costs of mixed wastewater treatment
(non-separation wastewater). Table 5.4: The composition samples of wastewater (see figure 5.3) of the batch dyeing of product G.TW.538 L5

bleaching, dyeing, pad-steam, and sizing & finishing stages. The material flow for a
typical continuous dyeing process of blended fabric coded G.TC.219, which is a mix of
35% cotton and 65% polyester dyed with vat dyes, is described in Table 5.5. The
quantity of blended fabrics dyed per continuous dyeing process is 347 kg/run. The
amount of all inputs (water, chemicals and dyestuffs) used during the continuous dyeing
process were recorded. Various wastewater streams generated by different stages were analyzed in terms of
flow rate, temperature, pH, color, and COD. Tables 5.6 (a) and (b) show the main
composition of wastewaters and flow rates of three main stages of wastewater
generation in the continuous dyeing process.

2x drying (130oC) Stage 5 Sizing and

about 27.9 m3/shift (this volume does not include the 3.49 m3 water used for chemical
dissolution). Out of the 27.9 m3 water 24.4 m3 was used for the washing steps which
accounts for 87% of the total water consumption. In total 25.218 m3 wastewater (90% of
the water supply) was produced from one shift of the continuous dyeing process.
Wastewater was generated from the bleaching stage (18 m3, 64% of total wastewater
volume), the pad-steam stage (7.2 m3, 28.5% of total wastewater volume) and the sizing
& finishing stage (18 L). However, some of these wastewater streams exceeded the
discharge standards, but some washing steps did meet discharge standards. In the
continuous dyeing process, the bleaching stage consumed much more water than the
pad-steam stage and sizing & finishing stage. The results from the flow chart showed
that the organic matter pollution, expressed as COD, mainly came from the bleaching
stage. The composition of bleaching stage washing wastewater (washing samples 1-8)
had a high COD in the range of 420-3,025 mg O2/L, and the pH was very high or low
(4.7-13.0). However, these samples had low color intensity (10-145 Pt-Co). With these
characteristics of a high biodegradability and low color intensity biological treatment
can be applied to treat this wastewater at low operational costs. Also energy can be
recovered from the biological treatment by using anaerobic treatment. In addition, the
volume of wastewater of the mercerizing unit of the bleaching stage generated about
500 L/batch, and the only pollutant in this wastewater was sodium hydroxide solution
resulting in a high alkalinity of the sample. This solution can be collected for reuse in
other manufacturing processes or for pH adjustment purposes in the wastewater
treatment system or for treating waste air from the boiler. The results of the pad-steam stage wastewater showed that the total volume of
wastewater generated in this stage was about 8 m3 of which only 2.0 m3 (washing 10,
11, 12 and 13) had a color intensity of 250-1,350 Pt-Co, thereby exceeding the
discharge standards TCVN 5945:2005, in average 5-50 times. In these streams, the
wastewater from washing 10 produced the highest color (1,350 Pt-Co). In contrast with
the wastewater from the bleaching stage, the pad-steam wastewater had high color
intensity and low COD. Therefore, for these streams the color needs to be treated. For
the remaining 6 m3 wastewater of the pad-steam stage (washing 9, 14, and 15) all
parameters met the discharge standards. The pH values of all washing wastewaters from
the pad-steam stage were over 8.8. These wastewater streams can be directly reused for
other units within production process. The sizing & finishing stage wastewater had the highest COD concentration with a
COD of 30,800 mg O2/L. However, the volume of wastewater was very low (18
L/batch). The feasibility of separated treatment of wastewater streams was assessed by estimation
of the operational costs. The estimated cost for separation of wastewater streams is
shown in Table 5.7. The results indicated that separating wastewater streams of the
continuous dyeing process reduces the volume of wastewater, saves chemicals and
water, and results in a decrease of operational costs. For the continuous dyeing process
the benefit is about 122 US$ per day or 36,600 US$ per year. 168 5.6 Conclusion In the manufacturing process of textile companies large volumes of water and chemicals
are consumed, resulting in generation of large volumes of wastewater with high
pollution concentrations. In general, three quarters of the total water consumption is for
the washing processes. Difficulties in treatment of the wastewater mostly arise from
mixing wastewaters from different process steps that have a variety of concentrations of
chemicals and dyestuffs. The treatment of the mixed wastewater cannot meet the
discharge standards although the operation costs of the treatment are as high as 15% to
30% of the production costs. From the results obtained, some conclusions can be drawn
regarding the separation of wastewater streams. The separation of wastewater streams in
textile companies seems a suitable measure for it facilitates treatment of each
wastewater stream separately in an optimal way. The separation of wastewater streams
allows not only the reuse of water and chemicals, but also for the effluent to meet the
discharge standards. The reuse of water and chemicals will save water, chemicals and
energy use, and reduces the quantity of the discharged harmful compounds as well as
exploitation of natural resources. Even when the operational costs are not reduced by
separating the waste streams, it can still be an attractive option. Undesirable influences
can be avoided in specific treatment processes compared to treating the mixed
wastewater. The similar results are found in literature. Mattioli et al. (2002) reported on
water reuse without treatment of water used in rinsing steps. Research on multiple use
of water in textile industry, Rott (2003) presented advantages of the split flow treatment
compared to mixed wastewater treatment; they were material recovery, higher recycling
rate and higher process water qualities at decreased costs. In the case of the 28 Company-Agtex, an average of 700 m3 wastewater/day was
generated from which 130 m3 water and 10 m3 of NaOH solution can be saved. About
350 m3 of wastewater has good biodegradability. Only 40 m3 of wastewater had a high
color intensity and COD which needs special treatment. The 28 Company-Agtex can
save 43,020 US$ per year by separating waste streams. The disadvantages of the
separation of wastewater streams are space for wastewater storage and an increase in
complexity of the system for split flows. 169 Table 5.6 (a) Composition of wastewater of the bleaching stage from the continuous dyeing process of blended fabric of the 28

This chapter investigates the greening of textile production by developing a model for
Thanh Cong Joint-stock Company, herein after called Thanh Cong Company (TMC).
This company is a typical large, state-owned Vietnamese textile and garment industry,
regarding both the scale of production and the high level of environmental pollution.
The chapter starts with a general introduction of the current situation with respect to
manufacturing and environmental protection of Thanh Cong Company (sections 1 and
2). Section 3 provides an extensive analysis of options for cleaner production and
pollution prevention in this company, applying experimental results from chapter 3, 4
and 5. Subsequently, using the various options a model for greening production is
proposed for the Thanh Cong Company, based on ideas of cleaner production and
industrial ecology. The last part of this chapter focuses on the actual and potential roles
of actor networks in supporting the actual implementation of the designed greening
production model in the Thanh Cong Company. 6.2 General description of the company
In the middle of 1960s, the Thanh Cong Company was established and located in
Hochiminh city, Tan Phu District, Vietnam. This location is not situated in an industrial
zone; it is in a semi-rural area and not far away from residential areas, so its
manufacturing process influences these areas. Presently, Thanh Cong Company has 21
departments and 5 plants with a total labor force of 4,200 people. It operates under the
Vietnam Textile and Garment Group (VINATEX), of the Ministry of Industry and
Trade. The products made at Thanh Cong Company include a wide range of yarns, woven and
knitted fabrics, knitted wears and sport wears. These products supply both domestic and
foreign markets, as products are being exporting to American, European and Japanese
markets. Table 6.1 gives the company’s average monthly production output. Table 6.1: Monthly average company production Products Unit Quantity Yarn (cotton, polyester, cotton/polyesters)

In recent years, the company’s yearly turnover has been more than 1,000 billion VND
(approximately 62,500,000 US$), from which the export turnover was 65% of the total
turnover; the remaining 35% comes from the domestic market. A scheme of the
company organization is depicted in Figure 6.1. This scheme shows that, although the
Thanh Cong Company is a large textile company, it does not have a specialized
department for environmental management. 175 Figure 6.1: Organizational scheme of the Thanh Cong Company

Workshop 176 Demand of raw material, water and energy Raw materials
The raw materials used in the Thanh Cong Company are cotton fiber, dyestuffs,
auxiliary and basic chemicals. Presently, nearly 100% of the raw materials for
production inputs are imported from foreign countries, mainly from Japan, the United
States, Switzerland, the EU, Taiwan and China. The annual demand for cotton fiber is
about 7,000 tons; for chemicals and dyestuffs it is in the range of 4,000-5,000 tons
(TCM 2005). Water According to our survey results of the production processes at the Thanh Cong
Company, the water demand is estimated at 8,000-9,000 m3 per day (Loan 2005),
mainly coming from groundwater sources. Energy
Thanh Cong uses two sources of energy: fuel and electricity. Fuel is consumed in
considerable amounts, mainly for the boiler and oil heater. Besides that, the company
also has a demand for gasoline for transportation means. The amount of fuel used per
year is given in Table 6.2. Table 6.2: Amount of fuel used per year in Thanh Cong Company

information, Thanh Cong’s electricity consumption is about 3,000,000 kWh per month
(TCM 2005). 6.3 Current environmental situation
In recent years, the Thanh Cong Company has started to focus on environmental
protection performance. It invested in a wastewater treatment facility in the year 2005
and joined the energy efficiency program of Energy Conservation Center in Hochiminh
City. The current situation of the company’s environmental performance follows below.
6.3.1 Air emissions Like all textile and garment companies, the dyeing plant is the major contributor to air
pollution of the Thanh Cong Company. Pollutants generally come from operation of
boilers and oil heaters. The composition of air pollution is shown in Table 6.3. The
concentration of particulates at all sampling points exceeds the permissible values for
air quality – industrial emission standards (TCVN: 5939-2005, class B). The SO2
concentration in the smokestacks of boiler No.1, of oil heater No.3 and of boiler No.2
exceeds many times the standards. For the other boilers and oil heaters, SO2
concentrations fall within the permissible values of the standard. The results indicate
that the source of air pollution is not treated adequately. The air quality of the working 177 environment at some plants and workshops of the Thanh Cong Company is presented in
Table 6.4. Almost all parameters, such as particulates, SO2, NO2 and CO, meet the
working environment standards of the Ministry of Health TCVSLD: 3733-2002. Table 6.3: Composition of polluted air from smokestacks of boilers and oil heaters

6.3.2 Noise pollution
Noise is a main pollution source for the weaving process of the Thanh Cong Company.
Noise generally comes from weaving equipment; the noise levels inside weaving plants
are about 85-90 dB, with the highest value at 95 dB. The noise level at the weaving
enterprise usually exceeds the permissible value of 85 dB for the working environment
quality (Standards of the Ministry of Health). The noise level in the spinning plant is
lower than in the weaving plant; it is in the range of 80-87 dB and reaches the highest
level at 87 dB. Noise is not a major issue for the dyeing plant, compared to the weaving
and spinning plants. The noise level inside the dyeing enterprise is in the range of 80-82
dB and meets the noise level standard. In particular, at areas with high noise levels the
workers are equipped with ear protecting devices to minimize the influence of noise on
their health. 178 6.3.3 Thermal pollution
Among the plants of Thanh Cong Company, the dyeing enterprise usually has the
highest indoor temperature, especially in dyeing and boiler areas. The temperature
ranges from 33-340C. The dyeing and finishing processes are carried out at high
temperature (160-1800C) and the boiler area harbors many thermal machines. For the
spinning plant, the average indoor temperature in the workshops is about 320C, however
there are some areas with temperatures of 330C, which exceed the permissible limit of
the standard TCVSLD 3733/2002/QD-BYT (permissible limit is 320C). The weaving
plant has the lowest indoor temperature among all plants; the average temperature is
about 310C. The high temperature at working places affects worker health. Presently,
the prevention of thermal pollution at Thanh Cong Company is only managed through
airy work areas with fan systems. Air pollution from Thanh Cong Company is not a major and significant issue. The air
quality of the working environment falls within the permissible standards. Only
particulates and SO2 generated from boilers and oil heaters of the dyeing enterprise need
suitable treatment to minimize the effects on worker’s health and environment. 6.3.4 Wastewater Industrial wastewater Among the plants of Thanh Cong Company, dyeing processes use a huge volume of
water, up to 70-75% of the total water demand of the entire company. Besides, the
dyeing enterprise also consumes a large variety of chemicals and as a result it
discharges a large amount of wastewater with high pollution levels. The company built
a centralized wastewater treatment facility with a capacity of 5,000 m3/day and brought
it into operation in December 2005. The applied treatment technology was a
combination of physical/chemical (coagulation/flocculation), biological (activated
sludge) and adsorption processes (with activated carbon). Although the wastewater
treatment plant was constructed as a relatively complete system, it has not operated
stable and with large efficiency. The reasons are that wastewater contains a complex
mixture of various kinds of chemicals and dyestuffs which are difficult to treat.
Coagulation/flocculation is the most commonly used process for the removal of color,
but it is not effective for the extreme variability in used dyestuffs. Figure 6.2 presents
the wastewater treatment system. In Table 6.5 the composition of the wastewater before
and after treatment is given. Treated wastewater exceeds the permissible values of the
Vietnamese standard (TCVN: 5945-2005, class B): color exceeds the standard value 47
times, COD 1.5 times, Fetotal 7.6 times and SS 1.3 times. The other parameters, such as
total nitrogen and phosphor, meet the permissible values. Each day, treated and
untreated wastewater from the Thanh Cong Company is discharged into Tham Luong
canal and contributes to water pollution of this canal, which is seen as one of the most
polluted canals of Hochiminh city. 179 Table 6.5: Composition of wastewater of the Thanh Cong Company before and

domestic wastewater is about 150 m3 per day. Black wastewater is treated by a septic
tank and after that directly discharged into Tham Luong canal. Grey wastewater flows
directly into Tham Luong canal without treatment. 6.3.5 Solid waste
Solid waste comprises of two types: domestic and industrial waste. Domestic solid
waste is generated mainly in canteens and a small quantity in offices. The quantity of
generated domestic solid waste is about 3 tons/month and collected by Nhan Huong
Ltd., Co. Industrial waste is divided into two types: non-hazardous and hazardous
industrial waste. The non-hazardous waste comprises fabric scraps, thread scraps,
packaging paper and cardboard and metal scraps. The estimated quantity is about 3
tons/month. All non-hazardous wastes are sold to waste purchasing units for recycling.
The hazardous waste includes sludge, waste oil, chemical and oil contaminated cloths
and fluorescent lamps. These hazardous wastes are collected and treated by Tho Nam
Sang Co., Ltd. The quantity of generated solid waste per month of Thanh Cong
Company is presented in Table 6.6. Table 6.6: Quantity of solid waste generated per month

Source: TCM (2008) Through the survey of the current environmental situation at Thanh Cong Company, it
can be concluded that wastewater and air pollution, such as SO2 and particulates, create
the most pollution problems. These pollutions affect directly the health of people
working in the factories and those living in residential areas. 6.4 Cleaner production/pollution prevention
The site survey on Thanh Cong Company shows that production processes are
generating much more waste than necessary, which has a negative impact on the
company but also on the environment. This opens opportunities to implement cleaner
production and pollution prevention at Thanh Cong Company. This section first
analyzes production processes in more detail to determine mass balances and secondly,
assesses cleaner production options for improving the present environmental
performance. 181 6.4.1 Production process and its waste stream Thanh Cong Company is a leading textile and garment industry, with a closed
technological process comprising four main sub-processes: yarn fabrication, fabric
production, dyeing & finishing and sewing. Through a survey of the entire production
process of Thanh Cong Company, it was found that the dyeing enterprise is generating
significantly more waste than the other ones. Therefore, this enterprise was selected for
implementing cleaner production options. A mass balance of material, energy and
emissions within the dyeing process should be made before identifying options to
reduce waste discharge. In order to give data on water, chemical and energy use, a
general scheme of the dyeing process together with generated wastewater streams is
presented in Figure 6.3. Figure 6.3: Flow diagram of dyeing process and waste streams Scouring / Bleaching

step of the production process. If the indicator concentration in the outflow is large, it
points at inefficiencies in the production process. If the concentration remains low, the
process performs better. Specific indicators in consumption of water, auxiliary
chemicals and dyestuffs are: -
Alkalinity for the scouring step;
-
CODtotal for the neutralization step using acetate acid and CODcoll for dyeing
step with auxiliary chemicals and not-dissolved dyestuffs;
-
Color for the dyeing step with dissolved dyestuffs; -
Total dissolved solids, suspended solids (SS), volatile suspended solids (VSS)
for the dyeing step with not-dissolved dyestuffs; -
H2O2 for the bleaching step;
-
SO3
2-, SO4
2- for dyeing steps. Analytical methods The analyses followed the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and
Wastewater (APHA 1995), as described in chapter 3. Method of determination of used dyestuffs In order to carry out a mass balance in the dyeing process, the calibration method was
applied for determining consumed and remaining dyestuffs after the dyeing step. This
method is based on measuring the strength of color with known dyestuff concentrations.
The strength of the color is measured by UV/VIS spectrophotometer with optimal wave
length, which was obtained from detecting the absorbance maximum in the range of
200-900 nm for each dyestuff. The six calibration equations for the used six dyestuffs in
the two dyeing processes are enclosed in Appendix 1. According to the determined
calibration equations, the concentration of dyestuffs before and after the dyeing process
can be calculated. From the consumption of dyestuffs the efficiency of the dyeing
processes is calculated.
6.4.3 Mass balance of water, chemicals and energy
Mass balances are necessary for identifying waste minimization options. The first task
in a mass balances is to make a flow diagram of the dyeing process. In the mass
balance, the inputs and outputs of each manufacturing process step are determined. In
addition, tests are carried out to estimate efficiency and loss of materials that occur
during the production process. As the dyeing technology is very complicated, it is
difficult to provide exact losses of material. However, estimation of consumption of raw
materials and loss of materials can be made through the different indicators (see next
section). The dyeing plant of Thanh Cong Company applies a dyeing batch method
(exhaust method), in which several steps are made on a dyeing machine. Through 183 observation and collected data, the mass balance focuses on two main dyeing processes,
which include the largest quantity of dyes in Thanh Cong Company:
-
Dyeing process of blended cotton/polyester (T/C) fabrics with red color: a dye
batch is for 227 kg fabrics with two stages in the dyeing process: first the
dyeing of polyester with dispersed dyes and then the dying of cotton with
reactive dyes.
-
Dyeing process of cotton with blue color: a dye batch is for 678 kg fabrics
using reactive dyes. Dyeing process of blended cotton and polyester fabrics Inputs and outputs of various stages in the dyeing process of blended cotton/polyester
fabrics are described in Table 6.7. It shows that the textile production process is very
complicated, especially when customers put higher requirements on the finished
products. Table 6.7: Listing of inputs and outputs of the T/C dyeing and finishing process

Source: Loan (2005; 2008) 185 Scouring and bleaching stages In the preparation stage, different steps such as scouring, washing and neutralization are
required. A combined scouring and bleaching step is applied to remove impure
substances in grey fabrics including fats, waxes and pectin. This step is traditionally
done by immersing grey fabrics in sodium hydroxide solution of 32% at elevated
temperature, together with chelating agents and emulsifiers. Selected parameters such as
alkalinity, pH and COD show that near half of the alkalinity remains in the output of the
scouring step. Alkalinity in the output was around 1,900 mg CaCO3/L. Hence sodium
hydroxide is heavily wasted in the scouring step; this opens up possibilities for
recycling sodium hydroxide or decreasing consumption with cleaner production options.
The COD of the input is caused by chelating agents (Vitex SL) and the increased COD
in the output is generated mainly from impurities originating from the grey fabric and a
small amount of remaining Vitex SL. The wastewater of the scouring and bleaching step
has a high COD concentration compared with other wastewater streams. After this step,
the fabric material is rinsed several times with water and then neutralized with acetic
acid. Hot and cold washing Hot washing: after each stage in the production process (such as scouring, neutralization
and dyeing processes), hot washing is the first washing step. With high temperature and
pressure, hot washing can efficiently remove dirt and remaining chemicals from fabrics.
Effluents of these steps often have a high temperature. However, total dissolved solids
(TDS), color and COD are not problematic, except in the step "hot washing 3" (see
Table 6.7), which has a high TDS and color. The reason is that a large amount of salt
and dyestuffs remains in the output. On the other hand, the output of some washing
steps has a similar water quality as the input water, such as hot washing 5 and 6. Cold washing: this step often takes place after the hot washing step. Effluent from cold
washing steps is low in COD and TDS, comparable to industrial effluent standards
(class B), except for cold washing 3. The output of washing 1, 2 and 4 has a low TDS
and turbidity and this output can directly be reused in any step of the production
process. The water consumption of hot washing and cold washing steps makes up 70 % of the
total water supply for dyeing and finishing processes. Therefore cleaner production
options will concentrate on the decrease of water use or the further reuse of washing
wastewater. Neutralization steps 1 & 2 The output of the neutralization steps has a low COD: a little higher than the industrial
effluent standard (class B). It shows that process control is optimal. The output from
neutralization steps only needs to be pre-treated before being reused in the next batch. 186 Dyeing step The dyeing step includes two parts. In the first part the polyester part is dyed, in the
second the cotton is treated.
Dyeing polyester: as mentioned in chapter 2, the dispersed dyes are mostly insoluble in
water and are really practical for coloring polyester fabrics. Therefore, calibration
methods cannot be used to determine the consumption of dispersed dyes; the COD of
the colloidal fraction (CODcoll) indicator is used in this case. Nearly half of the CODcoll
remains in the output; the fixation degree of dispersed dyes is thus about 50%. Dyeing cotton: the calibration method is suitable to determine the consumption of
reactive dyes in this dyeing process, because reactive dyes are mostly soluble in water.
It is calculated that about 60% of the reactive dyes goes into fabrics and 40% remains in
the wastewater. In addition, during dyeing with reactive dyes, a large amount of salt
(Na2SO4) is used for electrolytic dissociation, which helps to increase dye efficiency.
Measurements of SO4
2- concentrations show that almost all salts enter into the
wastewater. Dyeing and finishing process of cotton fabrics
Dyeing and finishing processes for cotton fabric are similar to dyeing for blended T/C;
it only slightly differs in terms of used raw material (only cotton fabric), dyestuffs and
auxiliary chemicals. A flow diagram of inputs and outputs of the dyeing process with
cotton fabric is shown in Table 6.8. The following sections give more details about the
input and output characteristics for each step.

Source: Loan (2005; 2008) 188 Scouring/bleaching step
The output of the scouring/bleaching step has a high concentration of alkalinity,
revealing that sodium hydroxide is only partly consumed and significant amounts of
sodium hydroxide are found in the wastewater. Scouring chemicals used for this step are organic compounds, which cause the COD
load in the output. In addition, singeing chemicals on the fabrics are dissolved in the
solution during the scouring/bleaching step and add COD to the output. Hence, COD
cannot accurately indicate if the scouring chemicals are used in an effective way. Clear
is that the scouring chemicals give a high COD concentration in the input. Concentration of total suspended solids (TSS) in the output is higher than in the input,
because the purpose of the scouring/bleaching step is to remove impurities from fabrics.
It is also noted that a high concentration of TSS in the input expresses that the
preparation of chemicals by workers was not performed well, leading to a waste of
chemicals added. The volatile suspended solid (VSS) is an indication of the organic
matter content in the solution. The ratio of VSS/TSS in the output (52%) is higher than
in the input (40%) as a result of the removal of organic impurities from fabrics.
The TSD concentration decreases in the output because a part of the sodium hydroxide
is consumed during the bleaching step. According to our analyses, the amount of consumed H2O2 is about 70% and the
remaining 30% enters into the output. The data of input and output of the scouring/bleaching step shows that sodium
hydroxide is ineffectively used and wasted and optimizing production should be
considered. A high COD in the output opens possibilities for cleaner production
options.
Neutralization 1 & 2 steps Wastewater generated from neutralization steps gives a low COD which means that
wastewater can be reused in the next batch to prepare the neutralization solution.
Hot washing and cold washing steps Hot washing steps: there are five hot washing steps in the dyeing process of cotton
fabrics. Outputs of hot washing steps usually have a high temperature (70-800C). Hot
washing steps gave the following results:
Hot washing 1: effluent contains a high TDS and COD concentration because of the
scouring step wastes that are washed out in hot washing 1. Hot washing 2: effluent COD, TDS and color in the output have the highest value
among the hot washing steps; after the dyeing process, the remaining auxiliary
chemicals and dyestuffs on fabrics are washed out completely into the output of this
washing step. Hot washing 3: effluent COD and color only just exceed the industrial effluent
standards; output of hot washing 3 could be treated together with output of the dyeing
unit. Hot washing 4 and 5: effluent COD and TDS are lower than the industrial effluent
standards (class B). Thus wastewater can be reused in other units or for other purposes.
Cold washing steps: output TDS and COD concentrations of cold washing 1 are high
due to remaining chemicals and impurities of fabrics which are washed out. During the
next cold washes (washing 2, 3 and 4) the TDS and COD of the output increases 189 insignificantly compared with the input. TDS in output is about 314–600 mg/L COD,
which is in the range of 9–15 mg O2/L, where the lowest COD is 9 mg O2/L (for
washing 2) and 15 mg O2/L (for washing 4). Therefore, outputs from washing steps 2
and 4 can directly be reused in washing 1 during the next batch.
Dyeing step with cotton
Two indicators (color and sulfate) are used in analyzing inputs and outputs of the dyeing
step of cotton. According to the calibrated equation of color (as established above) the
amount of reactive dyes in input and output are 34.7 g and 15.1 g. The consumption of
dyestuffs can then be quantified as about 60%. This result corresponds with the fixation
ratio of dispersed dyes, which is in range of 60-90%. The quantity of Na2SO4 consumed
in the dyeing step is almost insignificant; the sulfate concentration hardly differs
between input and output. The COD in input is mainly caused by reactive dyes and from
auxiliary chemicals (Bioflow PE). After the dyeing step, remaining COD in the output
is about 20% compared to the input COD. Mordal step
This step is performed in order to achieve a stable color of the finished product.
Compared with the input, the composition of the output of the mordal step shows a low
TDS and COD concentration. Thus the output can be reused in the next batch to prepare
the mordal solution.
Mass balance of water, chemicals and energy of the two dyeing processes
Mass balance of water
The dyeing batch is characterized by the ratio of volume of the dye solution (water) and
the mass of fabrics, herein after called liquor ratio. Thanh Cong Company is equipped
with high- pressure dyers (jet machine). For the operation of these jet machines, water is
added through the semi-automatic distribution system. The volume of water depends on
the liquor ratio; once the required water level is achieved, water supply to the dyeing
machine stops. After that, fabrics are brought in contact with the solution and the fabrics
increase the water level inside the dyer; this level is calculated and marked for the next
adding of water. After the first step in the dyeing process, the discharged volume
(output) is lower than the input because an amount of water is kept in the fabrics.
During the following steps, the volume of water input is equal to the water output. In
order to calculate the volume of each unit, the amount of water kept in the fabrics is
determined as follows: - First the mass of dry grey fabric is determined (before dyeing process); - Second, the water mass kept in the fabric is determined: the grey fabric is put
into the beaker containing water. The beaker with water and fabric is weighed.
After the (soaked) fabric is removed from the beaker, the beaker with the
remaining water is weighed.
The total water holding of the fabrics blended T/C and cotton can then be calculated:
- 227 kg of T/C fabrics holds 995 liters of water; - 678 kg of cotton fabrics holds 3,130 liters of water. The mass balance of water and the generated wastewater are calculated based on inputs
and outputs of the two flow diagrams of dyeing T/C and cotton processes (Tables 6.7
and 6.8). The results are presented in Table 6.9 and 6.10. 190 Table 6.9: The mass balance of water and wastewater for the dyeing process with
T/C fabrics

Source: (VINATEX 2003); Loan (2004; 2005) and (TCM 2005) 191 Specific water consumption and wastewater generation for dyeing and finishing T/C
fabrics and cotton process can now be calculated: Specific water consumption of T/C fabric: 34,820 L for 227 kg fabric = 157 L/kg
Specific water consumption of cotton fabric: 126,330 L for 678 kg fabric = 86 L/kg
Specific wastewater generation of T/C fabric: 30,505 L per 227 kg fabric = 134 L/kg
Specific wastewater generation of cotton fabric: 110,880 L for 678 kg fabric = 163 L/kg According to Thanh Cong Company, daily production capacity of the enterprise is about
55 tons of finished fabrics, of which the capacity of knitted fabrics is about two times
higher than of woven fabrics. Therefore, production capacity of woven fabric (cotton) is
18,200 kg and knitted fabric (blended T/C fabric) is 36,800 kg. The total water
consumption of and wastewater generation can be calculated: Total water consumption for one day per fabric type is: -
For woven fabrics:
18,200 kg / 678 kg / batch  126 m3 water / batch = 3,382 m3/day -
For knitted fabrics: 36,800 kg / 227 kg / batch  34.8 m3 / batch = 5,640 m3/day Total water consumption for one day:
3,382 m3 / day + 5,640 m3 / day = 9,022 m3/day Total generation of wastewater for one day per fabric type:
-
For woven fabrics: 18,200 kg / 678 kg  110 m3 / batch = 2,952 m3/day -
For knitted fabrics: 36,800 kg / 678  30.5 m3 / batch = 4,945 m3/day Total generation of wastewater for one day:
2,952 m3 / day + 4,945 m3 / day = 7,897 m3/day Hence, water consumption for cotton fabrics is higher than for T/C fabrics. Because the
raw cotton material contains a larger amount of impurities than polyester material, the
dyeing process with cotton fabrics consumes more water than T/C fabrics and thus it
discharges a larger volume of wastewater with higher levels of pollutants. The specific
water consumption and wastewater generation of some large textile companies in
Vietnam and in the world is presented in Table 6.11. As shown, only small differences
exist between the specific water consumption of the Thanh Cong Company and other
large textile companies in Vietnam. The Agtex Company uses a continuous dyeing
process with a pad-steam dyer. The Dong A and Phuoc Long Company use the same
dyeing batch process as the Thanh Cong Company. The Thanh Cong Company
consumes less water than the maximum use of the UK Textile Industry and the
maximum standard of USA/US EPA; but it uses more water than the maximum use of
the India Textile industry. But the minimum specific water consumption for these three
countries is significantly lower than for the Thanh Cong Company and other
Vietnamese textile companies. 192 Table 6.11: Specific water consumption and wastewater generation of some large

Source: * VINATEX (2003), Viet (2003), TCM (2005), (a) Visvanathan. et al. (2000) Given the close relationship between specific water consumption and specific
wastewater generation, it is no surprise that the company with the highest specific water
consumption also has the highest specific wastewater generation. Wastewater
generation of the Thanh Cong Company is lower than the WHO (1993) standard, but
1.5 times higher than the minimum level of the World Bank (1997) standards. Thanh
Cong’s specific wastewater generation is equal with the UK Textile Industry. Mass balances of chemicals According to indicators as described in section 6.3.2, inputs and outputs of chemicals in
each unit of the two dyeing processes are used to calculate mass balances of chemicals.

Source: Loan (2004; 2005) 194 Obtained results for the mass balance per dyeing batch show that auxiliary chemicals
(salts) and washing chemicals are hardly consumed, in the range of 5-15%; this is
representative for all textile processes. Sodium hydroxide used in the scouring step is
consumed at a medium level of 60% and the remaining 40% is discharged through the
wastewater. For the neutralization step, 90% of the acetic acid is consumed; this means
that there is good process control. To estimate the amount of dyestuff used in both
processes, the fixation of dyestuffs can be used. For instance, reactive dyes have an
average fixation of 60 to 76% and dispersed dyes give an average fixation level of 50%.
The possibilities to carry out cleaner production options are thus significant, especially
for reducing sodium hydroxide (dyeing process with T/C fabrics) and dyestuff
discharges. Energy and mass balances of boiler Energy is used extensively in the dyeing plant; this plant consumes about 85-87% of the
total energy consumption of the Thanh Cong Company. Therefore, the dyeing plant is
selected to carry out cleaner production options. It is necessary to determine energy
efficiency through gaseous emission and fuel use. According to supplied data from the
Thanh Cong Company and the composition of air pollution of the boilers of the
company (Table 6.14), the loss of energy during operation processes of boilers and the
efficiency of the boilers can be determined by two methods. Table 6.14: Composition of air pollution from boilers the Thanh Cong Company

Source: TCM (2005) 6.4.4 Analyzing waste generation In order to assess options for cleaner production at the Thanh Cong Company, the
causes for waste generation in each step of dyeing are analyzed in detail. Based on the
results gathered from the survey, observation and mass balance calculations, the causes
for waste generation in each step of dyeing processes are presented in Table 6.17. 196 Table 6.17: Cause for waste generation in each step of dyeing processes Process unit Cause
Scouring/bleaching
- High percentage of impurities in grey fabrics, especially in cotton fiber
causes a high COD, BOD, suspended solids (SS) concentration.
- High liquor ratio leads to a huge amount of wastewater and chemicals
discharged.
- After the scouring process 40% of the added sodium hydroxide is
discharged. Wastewater is characterized by a high pH, because of this
sub-optimal scouring step.
- Wastewater in this unit contains about 50% of the total COD, BOD
load of the whole dying process
Hot washing
- High liquor ratio results in a large amount of wastewater.
- The several hot washing steps applied in this process lead to a great
volume of wastewater with high temperature. Due to high temperature,
loss of fuel can be expected in these steps, causing air pollution. Neutralization - High liquor ratio leads to high consumption of chemicals and
remaining chemicals will go into wastewater.
- Acetic acid used in neutralization step adds to the COD load in the
wastewater.
Washing
- The several washing steps need a large water volume, creating huge
flow rate of wastewater. The wastewater of this step has a COD
concentration that is not problematic. Dyeing - Dyeing methods carried out by a discontinuous process (exhaust batch)
consume more water, auxiliary chemicals and dyestuffs. - High liquor ratio, hence more wastewater, auxiliary chemicals and
dyestuffs discharged.
- Spilled dyestuffs and chemicals at chemical preparation areas; after
cleaning workshop these chemicals increase COD load and color
causing complex wastewater and wastage of materials. - Dyer does not function well causing high consumption of materials,
water and energy. - Finished fabrics cannot meet quality requirement; re-dyeing leads to
more consumption of chemicals, water, energy and generation of more
wastes. - The cooling water is discharged without recycling, which increases the
wastewater volume and increases the dimensions of the WWTP. - Fixation of dyestuffs is not high leading to high color and COD in
effluent, difficult treatment and high treatment cost.
- After dyeing step, almost all auxiliary chemicals go into wastewater;
only a small part is consumed in the dyeing step. This will cause a high
TDS, which affects biological treatment methods. Stabilization of color
- High liquor ratio in dyeing process generates huge amount of
wastewater. - The consumption of stabilizing chemicals is relatively low. It results in
a high COD load and high pH in effluent.
Mordal color
- High liquor ratio in dyeing process causes a huge amount of
wastewater - Mordal chemicals are not much consumed in finishing process, leading
to high residual concentration in effluent. 197 6.4.5 Cleaner production options
The obtained results listed above are used as a basis to identify cleaner production
options for environmental improvements at the Thanh Cong Company. Cleaner
production options can be carried out in many different ways, but have to be feasible in
practice. For this reason, proposed options have to be selected on the condition of
feasibility for the Thanh Cong Company. In practice, not all proposed options can be
implemented at the same time because they require large financial and human
investments that the company cannot afford at once. So priorities have to be set. In the
short term, improvement of good housekeeping, reuse of water, chemicals and
replacement of dyestuffs are the most feasible measures to be carried out to reduce
pollution. In the long term, the company will have to be equipped with advanced
technologies and modern machines. Implementing cleaner production options will
significantly reduce waste streams and production cost and increase competitiveness by
a more environmental sound Thanh Cong Company. The priority order of proposed
cleaner production options for each unit of the dyeing process are described in Table
6.18. This table also shows the kind of (financial) benefits to be gained from these
options. Table 6.18: Cleaner production options and benefits for each unit

significant waste production is a sign of inefficiency. The company has a large potential
for cleaner production, which can save costs and reduce environmental impacts. The
largest environmental benefits are the improvement of water quality of Tham Luong
canal and the reduction of air pollution. The implementation of the proposed options reduces water use with 4,000 m3/day by the
reuse of all cooling water and a part of washing and hot washing water. The cooling
water volume per batch is 5 m3 for blended fabrics and 10 m3 for cotton fabrics. About
11.8 m3 of the cold and hot washing water meets water supply quality and can be reused
directly. The investment of a modern dyer with a low liquor ratio (1:6) will decrease the
amount of consumed water and energy compared with the old dyer (with liquor ratio
1:8-1:12). For instance, water use decreases from 0.161 to 0.108 m3/kg fabric,
electricity consumption from 0.603 to 0.418 kWh/kg fabric and fuel cost reduces from
1,824 to 1,192 VND/kg fabric (TCM 2008). Improvements of process control and
materials substitution result also in environmental benefits. According to this study, the
amount of sodium hydroxide can be reduced by 30% by optimal process control. As
noted in chapter 3, with mixed dyestuffs in the wastewater, decolorization is a difficult
and costly task. By substitution of old for new dyestuffs, the consumption of dyestuffs,
salts and auxiliary chemicals can be reduced, resulting in reduced loads of color, total
dissolved solids and organic compounds into environment. For example, the used
dispersed dyes can be replaced by new dyes with a high degree of fixation (90%), which
reduces the dyestuff load in the wastewater to 2,257 g per batch for blended fabrics.
Replacing the present low degree of fixation dyes (57%) dyes with high fixation
reactive dyes for cotton (85-95%), a significant amount of reactive dyes can be saved.
This reduces the release of toxic absorbable organic halogens (AOX) components from
reactive dyes. In addition, colored wastewater reduces the light transmission in water
streams and thereby disturbs photosynthesis. High salt concentrations significantly
affect the operation of biological wastewater treatment systems and an amount of 2 g
sodium chloride per liter can be toxic to fish. In addition, sewer systems erode at high
sulfate concentration.
In the short-term, the proposed cleaner production options are often improving
procedures and ways of operation rather than technology. With that Thanh Cong’s
production process cannot avoid waste generation, especially wastewater. Although
wastewater streams are reduced in volume and load, they still have to be treated in order
to recycle wastewater and reduce water use. 201 6.4.7 Economic benefits Economic benefits from the proposed cleaner production options can be estimated. Each
option can be calculated in terms of investment costs, cost of operation, savings and
payback period. The payback period is commonly used because it is easy and fast to
calculate. In Table 6.19 the benefits of the proposed cleaner production are presented
and Table 6.20 the estimated investment costs and payback period for the proposed
cleaner production options are given. Water and wastewater
Water Among the proposed cleaner production options, water reuse has the lowest economic
benefit. This is not surprising as ground water exploitation is free of charge for the
company. Presently, treatment fee of groundwater is about 750 VND/m3 (approx. 0.043
US$ /m3 water), which consists of electricity and labor costs. Water costs are
insignificant in the total production costs. Hence, Thanh Cong Company does not pay
attention to saving water. With a reuse volume of 4,000 m3 water per day, the economic
benefits are 3,000,000 VND/day (approx. 172 US$/day).  However, benefits are about 6
times higher if the water was purchased from a water company (4,200 VND or approx.
0.25 US$/m3). Since May 2010 groundwater use is banned or a natural resource
exploitation water fee is due. In addition, the volume of water for treating air pollution
every day is approximately 3,400 m3/day and the company can save from this
additionally 150 US$/day. Wastewater
Significant economic benefits relate to reducing wastewater treatment costs and
decrease of environmental protection charges. By implementing reuse of wastewater,
the flow of wastewater decreases from 8,000m3/day down to 3,100m3/day. The
estimated costs of treating one cubic meter of textile wastewater to meet the industrial
effluent standards are about 8,000 VND/m3 (in 2006). Once pollution loads decrease
with 30% for main materials such as dyestuffs and sodium hydroxide, the treatment
costs also reduce with 30% and the cost are then estimated at 5,600 VND/m3. With a
decrease of waste water flow of 4,000 m3/day, savings on treatment costs are 9,600,000
VND/day (approx. 565 US$/day). Other benefits can be obtained from the reduction of
environmental protection charges. According to the Joint Circular for environmental
protection charges No. 125/2003/TTLT-BTC-BTNMT of December 12, 2003 of the
Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, the
environmental protection charges are accounted based on flow rate and specific
pollutant concentrations in wastewaters. With a decrease of 4,000 m3 of wastewater per
day, the economic benefits are only 800,000 VND (50 US$). Energy The implementation of an automated water pump system results in saving 40 kWh/day
or 3.2 US$/day (average electricity cost is 0.054 US$/kWh). Reuse of cooling water, hot
washing and washing wastewater saves 1-2% in fuel use, an approximate benefit of  65
US$/day. Changing the old boilers for modern boilers and oil heaters, with a high
energy efficiency (80-90%), saves 225 US$/day in energy use. 202 Chemicals About 168 kg of sodium hydroxide can be reused per day from the scouring wastewater,
to treat SO2, saving about 1,500,000 VND/day or 93 US$/day. In addition, the amount
of sulphuric acid for neutralization of alkaline wastewater, can be reduced with 224 kg,
a cost reduction of 1,200,000 VND (approx. 74 US$/day). Each day, the Thanh Cong
Company can reduce chemical costs for the operation of the wastewater treatment
system by 2,700,000 VND (or 167 US$/day). Table 6.19 summarizes the total economic benefits when saving water, materials and
energy of the Thanh Cong Company through cleaner production options. The company
works 30 days per month, which results in a total benefit of VND 425 million or 35,280
US$ per month. This economic benefit equals the monthly salary of 260 workers
(average salary 2,2 million VND/month, approximately 137.50 US$). It shows that a
large company like Thanh Cong, with a high production capacity, greatly benefits from
the implementation of cleaner production instead of paying for treatment. Table 6.19: Total benefits (excluding investment costs) following cleaner

18 204 6.4.8 Wastewater treatment Thanh Cong built a wastewater treatment system with a capacity of 5,000 m3/day with a
combination of physical/chemical, biological and adsorption methods. However, the
effluent usually does not meet the discharge standards for the recipient surface water
(TCVN 5945:1995, class B). The treatment system consumes a large amount of
coagulant and activated carbon, leading to high operation costs. The proposed cleaner
production options for the Thanh Cong Company help to reduce the flow rate of
wastewater. However, the textile production processes will still generate wastewater.
According to the results presented in chapter 4 and 5, together with the implementation
of a closed water loop, the wastewater treatment system can be improved. This process
comprises two stages. First, the wastewater streams should be separated, the next stage
is to treat each stream with a suitable technology. Separation of wastewater streams for dyeing processes of blended fabrics is listed
below.
- Stream No.1 comprises wastewater of the scouring and hot washing 1 step. This
stream, which has high alkalinity concentration, is used to treat air pollution from
boilers or it is used to optimize pH (5.0-5.5) for the coagulation process of the
wastewater treatment from the dyeing process of polyester fabrics (chapter 3).
- Stream No.2 is the wastewater of neutralization steps 1 & 2. This wastewater is
reused to prepare the neutralization solution for the next batch.
- Stream No.3 includes wastewater from the dyeing process of polyester (dispersed
dyes), stabilisation step and hot washing 2. In order to treat this stream, the first
treatment step is a coagulation process; the next step applies aerobic activated
sludge process.
- Stream No.4 consists of collected wastewater from the dyeing processes of cotton
(reactive dyes), hot washing 3 and 4 and washing 3 steps. The treatment technology
encompasses two steps. In the first step, ozone is used to remove color and the
second step is aerobic treatment to remove organic matter. - Stream No.5 concentrates all wastewater of washing 1, 2, 4 and hot washing 5, 6,
together with cooling water. This wastewater has a good quality and can directly be
reused for other processes. Separation of wastewater streams for dyeing processes of cotton fabrics: - Wastewater of scouring, washing 1 and hot washing 1 are joined with stream No.1
(see above).
- The wastewater of neutralization 1 with low pollution is gathered into stream No.2.
- Dyeing (reactive dyes), hot washing 2 and 3, neutralization 2 and washing 3
wastewaters are collected into stream No.4. - Wastewater from washing 4, hot washing 4 and 5 wastewaters and cooling water
are collected into stream No.5.
- Stream No.6 directly receives wastewater from the mordal unit. The generated
wastewater is less polluted so it can be reused in preparing the mordal solution for
the next batch. 205 The results in saving water and separation of wastewater streams are given in Table
6.21. Figure 6.8 shows six wastewater streams of Thanh Cong Company after
separation process and improved wastewater treatment technology at Thanh Cong
Company.

# to be treated According to Table 6.21 the flow rate of wastewater that should be treated decreases
from 7,954 m3/day down to 3,100 m3/day, coming from wastewater of stream No.1
(after treating air pollution 899 m3) and wastewater of stream No. 3 & 4 (with 2,196
m3). Hence, the improved wastewater treatment system can operate at a capacity of
3,500 m3/day. However, a small increase of pollutant concentration can be identified: -
As mentioned in section 6.2, the average flow rate is about 8,000m3/day with the
COD fluctuating between 183-300 mg O2/L. -
After recycling and reuse of the wastewater from hot washing and washing
steps, the flow rate of wastewater decreases in the range of 43-57%, depending
on the type of fabric. -
After introduction of cleaner production options, the amount of sodium
hydroxide decreases ± 30%, CH3COOH 10-20% and dyestuffs between 30-40%.
However, the flow rate decreases significantly (43-57%), hence the COD and
color load increases with 10-20% per liter of wastewater. With these results, an improved WWTP is proposed that operates more efficiently at
lower costs. In addition, the company will have the opportunity of expanding the
production process without expanding the WWTP. The flow diagram of the improved
wastewater treatment technology at Thanh Cong Company is presented in Figure 6.4. Wastewater

11 Figure 6.4: Flow diagram of improved wastewater treatment technology at Thanh Cong Company 207 In this treatment system a combination of physical/chemical, biological and AOPs
methods can produce an effluent that meets the Vietnamese standards (TCVN 5945:
2005, class B). Treated wastewater can contribute to the improvement of the water
quality of the Tham Luong canal. It can also be used for irrigation on surrounding
agricultural areas in Binh Tan and Go Vap districts. 6.4.9 Treatment of air pollution
Although the Thanh Cong Company achieves a high-energy efficiency, the air pollution
from boiler operation exceeds the permissible values. Presently, the air treatment system
cannot meet air quality allowable concentrations of dust and inorganic substances and
the operation costs are high. Total loading rate of air pollution and flow rate of waste air
is calculated by modeling air emission inventories and control for commercial boilers,
using different fuels (WHO 1993). Table 6.22 presents the results of the calculation of
remaining pollutants and flow rates in generated exhaust gasses after implementation of
cleaner production options. The results show that only two parameters, dust and SO2,
exceed the permissible values, so that they have to be treated. A treatment system is
designed reusing scouring wastewater to treat the air pollution from boiler. The scheme
of the air pollution treatment set-up is illustrated in Figure 6.5. The scouring
wastewater, some sources of hot washing and washing wastewater usually have a high
alkalinity; values of pH are higher than 11. For the wastewater treatment system, a large
amount of sulphuric acid is used to neutralize the alkaline wastewater. The scouring
wastewater can be reused for treating SO2. With applying the double alkali method
(Stanley 2005), not only SO2 is removed, but also expensive sodium hydroxide solution
is regenerated with inexpensive lime (lime is 6 times cheaper than sodium hydroxide)
and forms the valuable product gypsum. The reaction of treating SO2 and regenerating
sodium hydroxide is illustrated in equations (1) and (2). 2NaOH + SO2 → Na2SO3(s) + H2O (1)
Ca(OH)2 + Na2SO3  → CaSO3(s) + 2NaOH (2) In the equation (3) gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) is formed, which has commercial values in
the manufacturing of plasterboard. The neutralization reaction is expressed in equation
(4). CaSO3(s) +1/2O2 + 2H2O  → CaSO4.2H2O (s) (3)
H2SO4 + 2NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2H2O (4) 208 Table 6.22: Calculated pollutant concentrations in exhaust gas from boilers

The load of hazardous waste decreases hardly after implementation of the proposed CP
options. By sending empty containers back to the supplier, a reduction of approximately
50 kg (50%) per month of chemical packaging waste can be reached. The waste oil can
be separated at the source, after which a part of the waste oil can be reused to maintain
sewing machines; this reduces 10% or 50 kg of the generated waste oil per month. The
amount of waste sludge is also decreased by reduction of pollutant concentration and
volume of wastewater. However, some types of industrial waste remain after application of pollution
prevention measures. Therefore, they have to be treated outside the company. Following
the objectives of industrial ecology, recycling of hazardous and domestic waste is
needed. There is a significant market for recycled waste oil in Hochiminh city. The
Thanh Cong Company can earn money from selling waste oil to recycling companies.
These are located in the Thu Duc district, Hochiminh city (17 km from the Thanh
Cong). Other hazardous waste is treated (on contractual basis) by a specialized company 210 with an incinerator and air pollution treatment system; this company is located in Binh
Chanh district, which borders on the Tan Phu district. Valuable non-hazardous solid
waste is sold for different reclamation purposes. Large fabric scraps are used to
manufacture cloths. Small fabric scraps are used as toys stuffing or as a raw material for
paper towel production. Scraps of soft yarns and yarns with poor quality are used as
material for making mops. Cardboard, plastics and paper are also sorted at the source
and are sold to scrap buying companies who sell these to specific recycling companies.
Almost all recycling activities are carried out in the districts of Go Vap and Tan Binh in
Hochiminh city, at about 10 km from Thanh Cong Company. Organic matter usually makes up 80-90% of the domestic solid waste in Vietnam,
perhaps a little lower at industrial enterprises. Still, sorting at the source is very
important for a successful composting process. Thanh Cong generates monthly about 3
tons of domestic solid waste. With implementation of separating at source, 2.4-2.7 tons
of organic matter can become raw material for composting plants, which are located in
the same area as the sanitary landfill (Cu Chi district, Hochiminh city). Composting
products can be used in the surrounding countryside of Tan Phu district, or at rubber
tree and cotton farms in Dong Nai and Tay Ninh provinces. The remaining non-organic
matter (10-15%), can be sold together with non hazardous industrial waste.
6.5 Greening production model for textile industry
Through the results presented above, it can be seen that dyestuffs, auxiliary chemicals,
water and energy consumption in Thanh Cong Company will be reduced when the
proposed cleaner production options are implemented. However, an amount of waste is
still generated from the production process. This shows cleaner production can help
environmental improvement in industry, but is not sufficient to deal with all waste
streams. It needs to be combined with a waste exchange network, both on-site and off-
site. Figure 6.6 shows the proposed greening production model of Thanh Cong
Company. 211 Figure 6.6: Model of greening production at Thanh Cong Company

widely disseminated, policies and measures to promote implementation of greening
production are not readily available. The next section will analyze the role of actor
networks as promoters in the development of the greening production model in
Vietnam. 6.6 Actor networks in support of greening production in Thanh Cong Company The introduction of cleaner production options at Thanh Cong Company does not only
or even mainly depend on company internal relations, but is significantly motivated or
hindered by the functioning of external actor networks. An analysis of these networks
helps to understand possibilities for the implementation of the greening production
model for the textile industry. Three actor networks are involved and are analyzed,
being the economic, policy and societal networks. 6.6.1 Economic network
An analysis of the economic network in which Thanh Cong Company is embedded,
focuses on three dimensions. First is the economic interactions between the company
and its suppliers and customers; the second dimension encompasses the interaction
between the company with other textile companies producing similar products, directly
or via branch associations; the last dimension relates to the interaction between the
company with other economic agents such as banks, research institutes and waste
treatment companies. Supply chain actors Raw material suppliers Thanh Cong’s production input requires about 7,000 tons raw cotton per year.
Vietnamese cotton fiber companies are not able to meet this material requirement.
According to An (2007), the Vietnamese fiber companies only satisfied about 10-15%
of the national raw cotton demand in 2007, making overseas imports necessary. The
Thanh Cong Company imports about 90% of natural raw cotton from foreign
companies, especially from China, Pakistan and the United States. The raw cotton
quality is one of the important factors affecting production technology and wastewater
treatment costs. Low quality raw cotton contains a high amount of impurities such as
fat, wax and pectin. This leads to the use of large amounts of chemicals, water and
energy in the preparing step of dyeing and finishing processes. Subsequently these
impurities are discharged into wastewater, causing a high COD load and a difficult and
costly treatment process. Thanh Cong Company can control the quality of imported raw
material by making contracts with suppliers, involving cotton quality (less than 2%
impurities) and price. High quality raw material thus reduces production expenses
because of decreasing consumption of chemicals, water and energy as well as
minimized organic loads into the wastewater treatment system. The preparation step
(scouring/bleaching step) makes up about 50-70% of the COD load in the effluent and
consumes a large amount of chemicals in the treatment process. 213 Like any textile company, Thanh Cong Company consumses a large amount of
chemicals, especially in the dyeing and finishing process. However, the chemical
industry of Vietnam is not able to produce these chemicals for the textile industry. Most
chemicals and dyes used at Thanh Cong Company are imported, mainly from
Switzerland, the EU, US, Japan, Taiwan and China. Chemicals from Taiwan and China
are usually cheap, but of low quality resulting in a high concentration of chemicals in
the wastewater. This can be found in the chemical mass balance of dyeing and finishing
processes for blended and cotton fabrics of Thanh Cong Company. The high residual
dyestuffs and auxiliary chemicals after dyeing leads to intense color and a high total
dissolved solids concentration in wastewater streams, and needs difficult and costly
treatment. Hence, all relevant raw input materials for Thanh Cong depend largely on imports.
Selecting co-operation with foreign suppliers for buying high quality materials can have
a significant effect on environmental performance. But these foreign suppliers have
little influence of the material sourcing and selecting behavior of Thanh Cong
Company. Water supplier Thanh Cong Company consumes 8,000-9,000 m3 water per day from self-managed
groundwater sources. This reduces production costs as groundwater is free of charge,
while water utility supply costs (0.25 US$/m3) would contribute 10-15% to the
production costs (VINATEX 2003). Resolution No.17/2006/QD-UBND of February 2,
2006 of the Hochiminh People’s committee for management of water resource indicates
that in areas with a water utility supply network, groundwater exploitation is forbidden.
However, the Thanh Cong Company still exploits groundwater sources. According to
Thanh Cong, they built the groundwater exploitation and treatment system before the
resolution passed. They spent a large amount of money in building this system and have
to use groundwater until the payback period (estimated at 5-6 years) has passed. In
addition, the water supply company is not good enough to provide the quality of water
the company demands. According to article 28 of the LEP (2005), Thanh Cong
Company must pay an environmental tax for their groundwater exploitation and an
environmental protection charge for discharged wastewater. Until now the company has
not paid taxes for groundwater use. In 2004 and 2005, Thanh Cong did not have a
wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and they paid 447,214,560 VND (29,950 US$) per
year for environmental protection charges. After building a WWTP in December 2005,
they only paid 9,360 US$ per year, because the pollution load decreased significantly.
With no charges for groundwater use and low payments of environmental protection
charges, the company pays little attention to water saving in their production process. In
addition, diluted wastewater can be treated more easily and less costly. Proper
enforcement of environmental taxes for groundwater exploitation or enforcement of
using groundwater instead of tap water will put pressure on Thanh Cong Company to
implement cleaner production options to minimize water use and generation of
wastewater. These then not only bring economic benefits for the company but also
increase environmental performance. 214 Fuel supplier Fuel costs contribute significantly to production costs, in the range of 10-15%
(VINATEX 2003). FO is usually used in boilers and oil heaters. However, as the fuel
price increase continuously, Thanh Cong has studied to substitute a part of the FO by
coal and cashew skins, as these materials are cheaper than FO; but these fuels generate
more air pollution. The quality of fuel influences the operation of the boiler. High
quality fuel will decrease the amount of fuel consumption, the maintenance fee and the
operational costs of the treatment system. A contract for fuel supply has been signed
between the Petrolimex Company and Thanh Cong Company, in which the supplier is
bound to a fixed price and quality. The business department of Thanh Cong Company
discusses with the supplier the quality of fuel and Thanh Cong requires fuels with low
sulphur concentration resulting in less SO2 generation and reduced treatment cost. At
present, Thanh Cong Company pays more attention to fuel saving, due to the high fuel
price. Therefore the company joined the energy efficiency program introduced by the
Energy Conservation Center of Hochiminh (ECC-HCMC). Through this program, the
consumption of fuel and related air pollution has been reduced somewhat. Electricity supplier Electricity is required for some equipment and for lighting. In fact, electricity
consumption is insignificant compared to the amount of fuel used in boiler operations.
Tan Phu Electricity Company supplies the electricity for Thanh Cong Company
regulated by contract. Price depends on service hours during the day (low, normal and
peak times). The current power price does not encourage electricity saving for Thanh
Cong Company. In addition, the electricity price has hardly increased between 2005 and
2008. According to the Ministry of Industry and Trade (2008), the electricity price
increases at least 20% in 2009; this is probably not enough to stimulate Thanh Cong
Company to consider electricity saving through cleaner production. Consumer/customer Thanh Cong‘s products are not only for domestic customers, but also for the more strict
importers of their products. Main source of company profits come from exports (65% of
turnover) (TCM 2009). Thanh Cong Company focuses on the foreign markets, with
American, Japanese and European customers. Importers or foreign retailers not only
require high product quality and competitive prices, but they also ask exporting
companies for environmental performance and social standards (ISO 14000; SA 8000).
In order to fulfill these customer requirements, Thanh Cong Company built wastewater
and waste air treatment systems, introduced registration systems of hazardous waste
management, as well as improved the working environment at the company. With a total population of over 80 million in 2005, Vietnam really is a large domestic
market for the Thanh Cong Company. Local consumers highly appraise Thanh Cong’s
products; Thanh Cong Company was chosen as Vietnam’s High-Quality Goods
producer for many years. However, with more than seventy percent of the Vietnamese
population being low-income and young customers, price and fashion are more likely to 215 be sensitive issues than environmental performance. Hence, environmental criteria are
not mentioned as characteristics of high quality goods by domestic consumers. The role of importers in improving environmental performance at Thanh Cong
Company is significant, while local consumers have no influence on environmental
performance improvement at Thanh Cong Company. For exported products, especially
to large markets such as US, Japan and EU, an ISO 14000 certification will help
companies in penetrating these markets. In order to compete with other large exporters
in the world, Thanh Cong Company plans to apply for ISO 14000 in their development
strategies. Horizontal interactions between Thanh Cong and competitors At present, there are more than two thousands textile enterprises in Vietnam, of which
47 can be considered large textile companies An (2009). In terms of scale, the Thanh
Cong Company is classified as a large company and belongs to the state-owned sector.
In general, the production technology of local large textile companies is the same, with
four stages, but they differ in products. Few competitors produce the same products as
Thanh Cong Company. The competitors of Thanh Cong are large joint ventures and
foreign-owned textile companies. These textile joint ventures and foreign companies
have the advantage of more capital and better technologies and machines, so that their
products have a higher quality and lower price. In addition, inflexibility in the
production process is seen as one of the main competitive disadvantages of state-owned
companies in comparison with private companies, joint ventures and foreign companies. In order to improve competitiveness, Thanh Cong Company has carried out several
projects to improve technology, machines and change of materials. This resulted in
some reduction of specific material consumption, waste generation and energy use in
comparison with other large textile companies. In recent years, Thanh Cong Company built a waste treatment facility with high
investment and operational costs, contributing with 10-15% to the production cost. This
can cause a reduction in competitiveness of the company, compared to other companies
that discharge untreated wastewater or only dilute wastewater before discharging. Vietnam National Textile & Garment Group Vietnam National Textile & Garment Group (herein after called Vinatex) was
established by the Prime Minister, based on resolution No 253/TTg on April 29, 1995,
and is directly controlled by the Ministry of Industry. The group has 66 members
including institutes of economic and technology research, fashion design, schools for
training workers and technicians, trading departments, service companies and nearly
100 sub-companies An (2009). The main targets of Vinatex are: investment, production,
supply, distribution, import and export in the field of textile and garment; upgrade
technological applications, conduct research, application of latest developed
technologies and renovate equipment; provide training and refresher courses for
managers, technicians and skillful workers. 216 Nowadays, Vinatex has a significant influence on the textile and garment industry in
Vietnam. In the development strategy of the Vietnamese textile and garment industry
until 2010, with an outlook towards 2020, Vinatex is given the role of engine and core
position in the development of the textile and garment industry. With great
concentration in business activities, Vinatex realizes also that manufacturing production
pertains to environmental protection. To support environmental protection performance
for members within the group, Vinatex has established cooperation with the Vietnam
Cleaner Production Centre (VNCPC) to provide training courses in cleaner production
for their members. In addition, Vinatex acts as a guarantee for bank loans in cleaner
production application or waste treatment projects for group members. For instance,
Vinatex guaranteed a bank loan for the Thanh Cong Company to invest in a wastewater
treatment facility with total costs of 28 billion VND. Vinatex has also cooperated with
universities such as the Polytechnic University and Education and Technology
University, to perform studies on the modernization of textile equipment with low cost;
this helps companies with capital limitations to invest in new technology. In order to
improve the environmental performance of the textile industry, Vinatex can lead in
cleaner production and industrial ecology development strategies or action programs for
the group, as well as for individual textile and garment industries. Moreover, the group
could play a central role in exchanging information on environmental issues between
their members, for instance by disseminating experiences of Thanh Cong in
implementing the greening production model to their members. The group can help
raise environmental awareness among their members via training courses and show the
benefits of ISO 14,000 for exported companies. Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association (Vitas) is a unique organization representing
all economic sectors in the field of textile and garment production. This association is a
social-economic, voluntary organization, established in 1997. Vitas’ main activities are
to advise entrepreneurs in terms of production management, trade promotion, technical
skills, financial services and quality management in conformity with social standards,
international standards (ISO), technological renovation, investment and staff training.
Although this association does not directly engage in environmental reform for the
textile industry, it does play a role as facilitator of cooperation and coordination in all
activities of its members and with governmental and scientific-technological
organizations. The current role of Vitas in supporting environmental reform in textile
industry is limited.  However, as a representative of its members Vitas could help to
propose relevant solutions to the government to support the implementation of greening
production, industrial ecology and waste treatment among its members. Interaction with other economic agencies Banks The more than 40 state, private and foreign banks that operate in Vietnam are in strong
competition nowadays, resulting in low interest rates for lending, which is beneficial for
businesses. Thanh Cong Company receives support from many large banks, because
they are a large, prestigious and important client for banks. The company can easily 217 lend money to invest in technological upgrading and innovation, resulting in better
environmental performance with less material consumption and decreased pollution.
Hence, capital availability is not a major constraint for greening Thanh Cong Company. Research institutes Textile industry is one of the key industries in Vietnam for research and training
institutes. There are a few universities and specialized institutes for educating textile
industry specialists, mostly located in major centers, such as Ha Noi, Dong Nai and
Hochiminh city. Besides, many training programs focus on management cadres of
various levels, designers, skilled worker and technicians for spinning-weaving-dyeing
technologies. These training programs increase the labor productivity of the textile
industry and sometimes also improve environmental performance. For instance, the
Vietnam Cleaner Production Centre and Vinatex provide introductions and training
courses for cleaner production for their member companies, through a program
“Production cost reduction through cleaner production in Textile and Garment Industry”
which started in 2002. Thanh Cong Company offered to join a demonstration project in
this program. The Energy Conservation Center of Ho Chi Minh City works directly
under the Department of Science and Technology of Ho Chi Minh City (DOST) since
May 2002. Its aim is to gather dedicated scientists, technologists and managers from
various industries in making policies, offering resolutions and training on efficient
energy use and energy conservation for all socio-economic sectors. Thanh Cong's
programs for saving energy usually run via Energy Conservation Center of Hochiminh
(ECC-HCMC) for assistance. Environmental (treatment) companies Regarding waste treatment technologies the company prefers to collaborate with
environmental consulting companies and environmental firms, rather than universities
and research centers as the latter are too research oriented for such standard solutions.
Obviously, these universities should focus more on closed loop systems and industrial
ecology solutions, which require still more in-depth research. According to supervision and inspection data of the Vietnam Environment
Administration (VEA 2008) over the years 2006-2008, 74.7% of the industrial
enterprises had installed wastewater treatment systems by 2008. Although the
percentage of companies with wastewater treatment systems has increased recently, the
status of industrial environmental pollution has not improved (VEA 2008). Many
pollution treatment systems (85-90%) could not meet industrial effluent standards due
to unsuitable technology, high operational costs and poor operation. In order to improve
the industrial environmental performance, waste treatment companies will need to
promote new advanced technologies. But the quantity and quality of local waste
treatment companies is still limited. For instance, almost all wastewater treatment
systems in Hochiminh city are designed by 10 consulting, designing and contracting
companies, with limited competition on prices and technological innovation. To
improve services of waste treatment, the government can encourage investment of
international environmental companies through support of tax reductions and
copyright/patent laws. It can support local environmental companies by tax reduction on
imports (machine and accessories) and capital support in terms of low interest rates. 218 6.6.2 Policy network
In the policy network, the interaction between Thanh Cong Company and state
environmental management organizations is analyzed. As can be seen in the scheme of
Vietnam's environmental management organization (chapter 1), the highest
environmental authority is the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment,
followed by provincial Departments of Natural Resources and Environment and then
the district offices of Natural Resources and Environment. As a large company, MONRE is responsible for supervision and inspection of
environmental protection at the Thanh Cong Company. As Thanh Cong is located in
Hochiminh city, DONRE of Hochiminh city can also conduct inspections and request
environmental protection measures when it notices signs of violation in environmental
laws/decrees or receives complaints from the public. Thanh Cong Company was
brought in to operation before the launch of the Law on Environmental Protection
(2005) and therefore it did not have to carry out an environmental impact assessment. Over a period of 12 years (1993-2005), the company discharged wastewater and air
pollution to environment without any treatment and did not carry out any periodical
monitoring of environmental quality. Consequently, Thanh Cong was on the “black list”
(list of heavily polluting enterprises), although it did not encounter any problems having
that black list status. Only one time DONRE of Hochiminh city fined Thanh Cong for
17 million VND (1,062 US$), as air pollution exceeded industrial effluent standards. In
order to reduce the serious pollution in industrial production, the Prime Minister
promulgated Decree No. 64/2003/QD-TTg of 24th April, 2003, “Plan of strict treatment
for serious polluted enterprises”. As written in this decree, during the first stage from
2003-2007, companies such as Thanh Cong Company had to build waste treatment
systems and after that, all seriously polluting enterprises (such as the dyeing enterprises
belonging to Thanh Cong Company) will be relocated to a specific industrial zone. To
implement this decree, Thanh Cong built a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) with a
capacity of 5,000 m3/day and has also a plan to relocate its dyeing enterprises in 2012. According to Thoa (2006) and Loan (2004), to meet strict Vietnamese standards
treatment costs of one cubic meter of textile wastewater is estimated at 8,000 VND
(0.45 US$), excluding environmental protection charges. Since the Thanh Cong
Company discharges about 8,000 m3/day, 30 days per month, the treatment costs would
be 1,920 million VND per month (approx. 180,000 US$). Thus it is no surprise that
Thanh Cong did not treat wastewater over a long period of time and this still happened
even when the company installed the WWTP. The director of Dong Nai DONRE, Le
Viet Hung, stated that although they know companies pollute the environment and these
firms have been fined, they can not shut down the company, because of the employment
effects for instance over 4,200 workers within Thanh Cong Company. In addition,
Thanh Cong is a state-owned company, so they are less afraid for competent
environmental management agencies because Thanh Cong knows that these
organizations can not close the company. This shows that poor enforcement of
environmental regulations includes many causes. Firstly, making environmental policy
in Vietnam is still in its infancy, with an incomplete legal framework, inappropriate for
the current socio-economic development and environmental protection needs. Secondly, there is limited supervision and inspection, especially of industrial 219 companies, together with low penalties for environmental violations and low
environmental charges. Thirdly, government's appeasement in solving infringements in
environmental protection regulations is dominant. Finally, especially state-owned
companies have little to fear from stringent enforcement, as they are well-protected by
their parent ministries. To improve the situation MONRE has to improve the national laws, regulations and
complete the legal framework. MONRE also need to further develop and introduce
environmental taxes for exploitation of natural resources, develop industrial effluent
standards for textile industry, increase environmental protection charges and enforce
heavy fines for environmental violations. At present, existing policies on encouraging
cleaner production remain insufficient and MONRE should provide more details in the
legal frameworks to encourage and direct cleaner production as well as the development
of environmental management systems (ISO 14,000). In order to improve monitoring and enforcement, it is better that DONRE of Hochiminh
takes on responsibilities of MONRE. The local environmental management agency
(DONRE) can strengthen the frequency of supervision, inspection activities and a
coherent monitoring system aimed at Thanh Cong Company. This will motivate Thanh
Cong Company to carry out environmental protection measures. Once waste treatment
costs become a financial burden, Thanh Cong will consider greening its production
approach. Besides, supervision will provide feedback on the effectiveness of existing
strategies, policies, laws and regulations. It will not be easy to change the relation
between the parent ministries and the state-owned companies, but this seems essential
for setting the right incentives for greening the production of Thanh Cong. The Vietnamese Government can provide financial assistance for technological
innovation and the application of clean technologies through environmental protection
funds. These funds support environmental protection activities, which include cleaner
production, waste treatment, prevention of environmental incidents and pollution
control. The interest rate of these funds is very low (from 1to 2%/year, or even 0%
depending on the type of industries). At present, environmental protection funds are
established at the central and local levels and some funds related to environmental
protection are listed below:
- The Revolving Fund for Industrial Pollution Control in Businesses in Ho Chi
Minh City (established in 2001 with a capital of 2.5 million US$);
- The Industrial Pollution Minimization Fund in Ho Chi Minh City (IPMF,
established in 1999 with a capital of 1 million US$);
- Vietnam Environmental Protection Fund (established in 2002 with an initial
capital of 12.7 million US$); Up to April 2009, Vietnam Environmental Protection Fund had 85 projects with a total
capital of 10.3 billion VND (562 million US$). The interest rate at commercial banks is
higher than that at the Vietnam Environmental Protection Fund (7.5 to 12 times as
high). However, companies have difficulties to receive capital support from the
Vietnam Environmental Protection Fund for environmental protection projects due to
complicated administrative procedures. This is similar for the Revolving Fund for 220 Industrial Pollution Control and the Industrial Pollution Minimization Fund in
Hochiminh City. According to Decree No. 64/2003/QD-TTg of 24th April, 2003 issued by the Prime
Minister, Thanh Cong Company appeared in the lists of 4295 highly polluting industrial
enterprises. This company was asked to perform wastewater treatment in order to
minimize environmental pollution. Because the company is in the list of high polluters
Thanh Cong Company can receive capital support from Vietnam Environmental
Protection Fund (VEPF) to implement environmental protection measures. Thang Cong
Company is also a state-owned company, which is an advantage compared with private
companies for receiving a loan from VEPF. However, the administrative procedures for
the loan are very difficulty. The government has recognized the institutional weaknesses
of these funds and is making greater efforts to accelerate administrative reform. In Vietnam, regulations on taxes regarding import-export and environment change
continuously. Currently, companies should pay two main taxes: value-added tax with a
tax rate of 10% for domestic goods and a 25% gross enterprise tax with a rate.
Moreover, exporting companies have to comply with the law on import-export taxes.
The government has recently promulgated tax policies to stimulate the development of
export companies like the Thanh Cong Company. The textile and garment industry, as
an important economic sector in Vietnam, are provided with preferential loans with
interest rates 25% less than on normal loans (depending on current commercial rates).
The loan duration is 12 years with a three-year grace period. In Hochiminh city, the
local government provides incentives for textile companies to improve their production:
textile companies receive loans from the city budget with low interest rates (6%/year) to
upgrade their technology. This relates to preferential tax policies to support clean
technology in domestic investment in Vietnam as presented in Government Decree
55/2001/QD-TTg dated April 23, 2001. These include: - Exemption of the gross enterprise tax in the first 3-4 years and reduction of 50%
of regulated taxes in the next five years for hi-tech investment projects. Through
the new products companies should be able to compete effectively with similar
foreign products. - Appling 0% value-added tax rates on sales of domestically made fabrics to local
enterprises that make garments for export. - Exemption of import tax for equipment, machines and materials related to
technology innovation (the common import tax is around 10-20%).
6.6.3 Societal network
Societal networks focus on interactions between industry and society. In the absence of
non-governmental civil society organizations in Vietnam, this network comprises
especially neighbors, mass organizations and mass media. 221 Neighbors Most of the 60 textile (including Thanh Cong), paper, soy and instant noodles factories
at both sides of Tham Luong canal discharge highly polluted wastewater into the canal
without proper treatment. This canal is one of the most polluted canals in Hochiminh
city and its problems have existed for over 15 years. Monitoring results of the
Environmental Protection Agency of Hochiminh city during recent years (2002–2008)
show suspended solids (SS), BOD and coli form indicators increasing in consecutive
years, all exceeding permissible values many times. Especially the BOD concentration
exceeded the standards of surface water quality (TCVN 5942:1995, class C) 4 to 22
times at Tham Luong Bridge. Odor from Tham Luong canal can be noticed at 1–2 km
from the canal, negatively affecting the quality of life of people living at both sides of
the canal. Mrs. Dao Thi Bich Dau, a resident in an affected neighborhood, mentioned
she constantly suffers from bad smell and locals call it the "stinking canal". Many
households had to change the hour of having dinner to the late evening, to avoid
pungent fishy smell from canal during diner. Mr. Nguyen Van Si, representing a
households group at ward 13, Go Vap district, complained about the serious pollution
through wastewater discharges, leading to degradation of fish culture and of vegetable
cultivation areas surrounding the Tham Luong canal. Moreover, after heavy rain,
wastewater from the polluted canal floods into residents' homes. Following pressure and complaints of local citizens living around Tham Luong canal,
the local district government required that industrial sites should treat wastewater before
discharging it into the canal. These complaints had an effect on DONRE, as it
frequently inspects and tries to take action against companies that fail to treat their
wastewater properly. As results of these complaints, the government has considered the
problem in their master plan for pollution reduction in the Tham Luong canal. Though
the case study reveals the role of communities in environmental reform, as others have
done (Phuong and Mol 2004), their role remains limited. Via citizen‘s complaints, the
local government has made additional efforts to solve this problem by relocating
residents along the canal to a different area and by intensifying inspections. However,
environmental pollution has increased year after year during the last decade. Mass organizations Mass organizations, such as the Women union, Youth union and Veteran’s union (part
of the Fatherland Front), work closely with the government at provincial, district and
commune levels. Such organizations could help to file complaints of residents at
competent authorities. In the case of the Thanh Cong Company, local residents do not
complain directly about the discharge of wastewater from Thanh Cong, because
communities lack knowledge to relate the water pollution to the source. There are over
60 companies on both sides of the canal discharging wastewater into Tham Luong
canal. In 2007, the Fatherland Front of Tay Thanh ward submitted complaints on air
pollution (dust and odor) from Thanh Cong to the Tan Phu district office of Natural
Resources and Environment. As a result of these complaints, DONRE of Hochiminh
city inspected Thanh Cong, fined the company and required the building of waste air
treatment systems. After that, the air pollution situation remained the same. This shows
that the complain system does have a voice, but its effects are limited. 222 In preventing complaints, Thanh Cong Company keeps a close relationship with the
People’s Committee of Tan Phu district. When the Vietnamese Fatherland Front of Tan
Phu District launched a program to support poor people, the company contributed 500
million VND from its business profits. They also built a medical clinic to serve workers
and poor local residents. This all has most likely contributed to reduce complaints from
the community and mass organizations. Mass media
The media (radio, television and newspapers being the most relevant for Vietnam) are
increasingly paying attention to the environment. Violations of environmental
protection laws by enterprises, incidents and accidents, pollution situation of water, air
and solid waste at provinces/cities and the handling of violations by state management
agencies are frequently reported. Newspapers and magazines regularly covering
environmental issues are for example Liberated Sai Gon, Youth newspaper, Laborer
newspaper, Vietnam News, and People newspaper; for Hochiminh city are relevant
Youth, Liberated Sai Gon and Laborer. These newspapers also take up and articulate complaints. In addition, newspapers help
raising environmental awareness among the public. Newspapers reporting on serious
pollution at the Tham Luong canal by industrial activity included Thanh Cong in the
general list of polluters. Thanh Cong, as a major company in Vietnam, is sensitive for
such newspaper reporting, as negative publicity can affect its image in the eyes of
domestic consumers and exporters. 6.7 Conclusions Thanh Cong is known as a large textile company that gains foreign currency and
contributes to employment. However, its environmental performance is poor and high
waste treatment costs are an important cause for that. The results of our case study of
Thanh Cong Company demonstrate that the economy and environment benefits from
pollution prevention and industrial ecology in large textile industries in Vietnam. A
greening production model, combining cleaner production and external waste exchange,
is feasible and attractive for such a textile industry. The largest benefit is that the
application of cleaner production options, separation of waste streams and advanced
waste treatment technology decreases significantly the volume of wastewater and
chemical loads going into wastewater. In addition, an external waste exchange network
helps to recycle most remaining waste materials, by reusing it as raw material in other
companies. All this contributes to a sustainable development of Thanh Cong Company. The case study shows that various actors can be involved in the implementation of the
greening production model. In the economic network, the roles of customers (especially
importers) and Vinatex are important and a further pricing of natural resources
(especially groundwater) will also be vital in improving the company’s environemntal
performance. The policy network analysis revealed that the role of state authorities can
be influential in improving environmental performance, but is still limited in the current
setting due to a number of flaws at the national and local level. In recent years, concerns
and complaints of citizens and reporting in newspapers on pollution threaten to affect
the image of companies like Thanh Cong; this can contribute to behavioral change. It is
at these points in the actor networks that pushes towards the implementation of the
green production model can be expected in the future. Chapter 7 An industrial ecology m odel for Nhon Trach 2 Industrial Zone, Vietnam 224 7.1 Introduction In the previous chapter, the greening production model for the Thanh Cong Textile and
Garment Company provided a feasible and attractive new approach to sustainable
development of individual large textile companies. In previous studies Côté and
Smolenaars (1997), Chertow (2000), Zhu et al.(2007), Jin (2008), Graedel and Allenby
(2003), Erkman (1997), Ayres & Simonis (1994) and Lowe (1997), it was shown that
industry ecology can also reduce environmental impacts and use resources in an efficient
way for groups of industrial companies. To investigate the relevance of such an industrial ecology approach for Vietnam, an
integrated textile and garment industrial ecology model for Nhon Trach 2 industrial zone
(Nhon Trach 2 IZ) will be developed in this chapter. This model is based on a mutually
beneficial relationship of the geographical proximity of seven textile companies in the
Nhon Trach 2 IZ and an external waste exchange network. These two components
enable the minimization of impacts of the industrial system on the environment by
optimizing the material and energy flows going into and out of the industrial system. This chapter is divided into five parts. In the first section, the situation of the
development and current environmental performance of the Nhon Trach 2 IZ is shown.
The second section presents more details of the material inputs and outputs of the seven
textile companies. Subsequently, the development of a textile and garment industrial
ecology model based on the gathered data is discussed. The fourth section provides an
analysis of actors’ roles in implementing the model. The final section concludes the
analysis of an industrial ecology model at the Nhon Trach 2 IZ. 7.2 General description and environmental performance of the Nhon Trach 2 IZ The Nhon Trach suburb is located in the southwest of Dong Nai Province and is one of
the agricultural suburbs of Dong Nai province. The Nhon Trach suburb was established
in 1994 after splitting from the former Long Thanh suburb. The Nhon Trach suburb has
an advantageous position on the regional waterways and will become a future entrance
to Hochiminh City, which will facilitate its industrial development. Being aware of the
economic benefits provided by industrial development, the Government approved the
establishment of the Nhon Trach 2 IZ, which was established in 1997 under the
Corporation for urban industrial development No.2 (Company D2D). The communes of
Hiep Phuoc, Phuoc Thien and Phu Hoi are also located there. The location of Nhon
Trach 2 IZ in Dong Nai province and the location of the seven operating textile
companies in Nhon Trach 2 IZ are shown in Figure 7.1 and 7.2. This industrial zone has
a total area of 347 ha, in which the land area used for the industrial plants occupies
80.4% (279 ha) and the remaining area 68 ha is used for roads, public utilities and
vegetation watering. The industries that have invested into this industrial zone include: 225 -
Textile and garment;
-
Footwear and leather products; -
Electronic & electrical products;
-
Mechanical engineering; -
Building materials;
-
Wood processing;
-
Foodstuffs;
-
Chemicals; -
Cosmetics; -
Pharmaceutical products;
-
Services. In 2007, the Nhon Trach 2 IZ had attracted 52 projects with an area coverage percentage
of 100%. By then only 24 companies had been brought into operation; the remaining 28
projects were still under construction. Nhon Trach 226 Figure 7.1: Location of Nhon Trach 2 IZ in Dong Nai province 227 Figure 7.2: Location of seven textile companies in Nhon Trach 2 IZ
Location of seven textile
companies in Nhon Trach 2IZ
WWWP 228 7.2.1 Wastewater According to measurements of the wastewater flow rate of the 24 operating enterprises
in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ, the total wastewater volume generated varies from 13,000-
15,000 m3/day. The seven textile and garment companies have an aggregate metered
quantity of 13,900 m3/day of wastewater, comprising 96% of the total current volume of
wastewater of the entire industrial zone. The remaining companies produce the
remaining quantity of wastewater about 525m3/day, amounting to 4% of the total
wastewater flow. Although the coverage percentage has reached 100%, the industrial
zone has not yet completed the infrastructure, such as the drainage network and the
central wastewater treatment plant. Therefore, the operating enterprises in this industrial
zone have to treat their wastewater to meet the standards of TCVN 5945-2005, recipient
source class B, before discharging into the drainage system of the industrial zone.
Among the 24 operating factories, there are 21 companies generating industrial
wastewater and three companies releasing only domestic wastewater. Currently, 10
companies have built industrial wastewater treatment systems and the remaining 11
companies have not yet installed wastewater treatment systems. Domestic wastewater is
treated by a septic tank. Most treated wastewater at each company is drained into the
sewer system of the industrial zone before being discharged into the Rach Dua Canal.
To assess the impact of wastewater on the environment, effluent samples were collected
and analyzed. The results show that the textile companies are the main source of
wastewater at the Nhon Trach 2 IZ. For instance, the color fluctuates between 350-615
Pt-Co, the COD fluctuates around 140-450 mg O2/L, the BOD5 is in range of 35-110 mg
O2/L and the mineral oil concentration fluctuates from 2.9-15.2 mg/L. These figures
exceed the permissible values of industrial effluent standards (TCVN 5945-2005, class
B). Among the analyzed parameters, color is exceeded by 7-12 times, COD by 1.8-2.5
times and BOD5 by 2.5 times compared to the standards. On the other hand, the heavy
metal and surfactant concentration is very low and meets the standards for
concentration. This is also the case for the pH, which fluctuates between 7.0-7.4. Based
on the analysis results, the suspended solid (SS) concentration fluctuates from 20-114
mg/L. However, after 18:00h on the 13th, 14th and 15th of July 2006, the wastewater
samples had particularly high SS concentrations, up to 334 mg/L; in addition, the COD
concentrations were as high as 450 mg O2/L and the color was as high as 1,800 Pt-Co,
with a signature specific to textile wastewater. Some samples also indicate that certain
textile enterprises execute wastewater treatment in a rather obscure way. These
enterprises wait until after regular working hours to discharge untreated wastewater into
the canal because they are afraid that during administrative working hours (from 07:30
to 17:30h), environmental agencies might inspect their discharges. The large flow rate of wastewater causes erosion on the sides of the Rach Dua canal.
Most wastewater comes from textile companies and therefore has high color intensity
and a foul smell. When the water in the canal level is high the wastewater is diluted with
the canal water and overflows into the surrounding residential areas, also affecting the
cultivation of agricultural of the inhabitants in the region. In addition, the Thi Vai River
is the final recipient of the wastewater from various industrial zones in the Nhon Trach
suburb, among Nhon Trach 2 IZ. According to recent monitoring results of the Dong
Nai Department of Natural Resources and Environment, the BOD5 concentration in this 229 0.30

river exceeds the permissible level for Vietnamese standards for surface water quality
by 110 times (Dong Nai DONRE 2006). 7.2.2 Air pollution The results of monitoring air quality within and around the Nhon Trach 2 IZ, 2x
times/year point measurement by the D2D company (2006), are presented in Table 7.1.
These results, together with results of an investigation on environmental pollution
caused by activities of industrial zones during the first 5 years of the new Millennium in
Hochiminh City (Tuan 2007) show that for nearly all indicators the quality of the air
meet the Vietnamese standard (5937, 5938-2005, average 1 hour). Only the particulate
concentration exceeds the permissible value, due to truck traffic in the industrial zone.
The particulate concentration at some industrial zones is shown in Figure 7.3. Table 7.1: Monitoring ambient air quality at Nhon Trach 2 IZ Results

including Nhon Trach 2 IZ 230 7.2.3 Solid waste Until recently, the industrial zone did not have a sorting station and adequate equipment
for the collection and storage of industrial waste as mentioned in the Law on
Environmental Protection (2005). Currently, domestic solid waste generated by the
companies located in the industrial zone is collected and transported to a temporary
dump site in the Nhon Trach suburb by an environmental service company. Alternately,
some companies sign contracts with private companies to collect domestic solid waste
locally. Most of the hazardous waste is jointly collected with the domestic solid waste
and is buried either permanently or at the temporary dumping site. Moreover, a portion
of the hazardous waste is collected by scrap-purchasing units. They then separate the
waste; one part of waste is reused and the remaining hazardous waste is dumped on
unoccupied land or in canals, endangering the terrestrial and aquatic environment. One
of the hazardous solid wastes that is associated with textile companies is sludge, which
is generated from the wastewater treatment systems and left-over chemicals. According
to the report on monitoring environmental quality at the Nhon Trach 2 IZ of Company
D2D in 2006, the total generated domestic solid waste was estimated to be about 1.5-2.0
tons per day and the industrial waste was about 32-35 tons per day. The collected data
show that the amount of solid waste generated by textile companies is larger than any
other industry in this industrial zone. In brief, the wastewater, air pollution and solid waste generated in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ
is primarily due to the textile industry. Hence, the textile industry has to concentrate on
solving their pollution problems to ensure a balance between the economy and
environmental protection. For this purpose, we will develop a textile and garment
ecological industrial zone for the Nhon Trach 2 IZ, based on the existing industrial
zone. To realize an industrial ecology model, the identification of raw materials, energy
flow and the composition of waste of all companies in the industrial zone has to be
conducted. This information forms the basis for the selection of technologies for the
minimization, reutilization and circulation of the textile industry’s waste and for
designing a waste exchange network. 7.3 Current environmental performance of textile companies in Nhon Trach 2 IZ 7.3.1 General description of textile and garment companies Twelve textile and garment companies have invested in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ
representing the highest percentage (27%) among invested industrial companies in the
industrial zone. In 2007, at the time this research was executed, seven of the textile and
garment companies had already begun operation and the remaining five companies are
under construction. A list of the textile and garment companies in the IZ is presented in
Table 7.2. 231 Table 7.2: List of the textile and garment companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ Company Est. year  Investor Area

companies  in Nhon Trach 2IZ, 2006  (D2D company 2006) All of the seven textile and garment companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ were built
completely with foreign capital. The average monthly production capacity of each
company is listed in Table 7.3. These companies occupy 50% of the land area, generate
96% of the total wastewater, generate 90% of the solid waste and are the only
significant source of air pollution at the Nhon Trach 2 IZ, which is why only the textile
and garment companies are included in this study. In general, the textile and garment technology is composed of four basic processes:
spinning, weaving, dyeing & finishing and sewing (see Chapter 6). However, not all
textile and garment companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ have all four stages. While the
S.Y. Vina Co. Ltd has four processes, the remaining companies perform only two or
three of the four work stages of the textile industry (weaving and dyeing & finishing
stages, or spinning, weaving and dyeing & finishing stages). Most textile companies in
the Nhon Trach 2 IZ are equipped with modern machines and advanced technology.
Although the technology of these companies is modern, each company still generates a
large amount of waste and consumes a large amount of materials. 232 Table 7.3: Monthly average production capacity of each company Production capacity

and polyester fiber. The total raw material use per month of the seven operating
companies is about 6,200 tons. Similar to other textile enterprises, the textile companies
in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ use a large quantity and a wide variety of chemicals during their
production processes. The total amount of chemicals used per month by the seven
companies totals over 8,000 tons. Of this amount, the amount of dyestuffs used is 385
tons and other chemicals (such as auxiliary chemicals, bleaching agents, finishing
chemicals) account for about 7,780 tons. Demand for water, electricity and fuel At present, some textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ are using water from both
self-exploited groundwater and water from the Nhon Trach groundwater plant, which
has a capacity of 10,000 m3 per day. The electricity is supplied by the national grid
through sub-station 103 MVA of the industrial zone. A large amount of fuel is also used
in the production facilities. The fuel used for boilers and oil heaters is Fuel Oil (FO),
Diesel Oil (DO) and coal, but FO is increasingly being replaced by coal because coal is
cheaper than FO. Table 7.4 presents the monthly demand for water, electricity and fuel
of the seven textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ. 233 Table 7.4: Water, electricity and fuel demand of seven textile companies in Nhon

Trach 2 IZ
Wastewater Through the collected and analyzed data on the present environmental situation in the
Nhon Trach 2 IZ, it is clear that the textile industry is a polluting industry because their
wastes are heavily contaminated and they generate the largest volume of wastewater
produced among all the industrial sectors. The most significant pollution source of the
textile companies is wastewater. Table 7.5 presents the generated daily wastewater
volume and the capacity of the treatment systems of the seven textile companies in the
Nhon Trach 2 IZ. 234 Table 7.5: Wastewater volume and the capacity of treatment system of seven

dyeing and finishing processes, which produce a large volume of wastewater with a
high concentration of pollutants. This is also similar for textile companies in the Nhon
Trach 2 IZ. At present, all textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ have to treat their
wastewater to meet the industrial effluent standard of TCVN 5945:2005, recipient
source class B. Currently, all textile companies in the industrial zone have installed
wastewater treatment systems. The current wastewater treatment technologies applied in
these companies are described in Figure 7.4. 235 Figure 7.4: Scheme of wastewater treatment technologies of the seven textile companies in Nhon Trach 2 IZ

Equalization  tank 236 Table 7.6 presents the composition of treated wastewater of the seven textile companies
in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ. The results show that the effluents of these treatment systems
cannot meet the discharge standards of TCVN 5945:2005, class B, especially with
respect to color and COD. A survey of the present efficiency of the seven wastewater
treatment systems shows that, among the seven textile companies, the Yue Kun and
Ching Fa companies have regular and well operated wastewater treatment systems and
the remaining five companies do not regularly operate their systems or the treatment
systems are overloaded. This makes it difficult to assess the real efficiency of the
treatment systems. The Yue Kun and Ching Fa companies apply a technology
appropriate for wastewater generated during dyeing of synthetic yarn (using dispersed
dyes). For this technology, non-dissolved dyes are removed through a coagulation
process. Next, an activated sludge process removes the organic material. Although this
process achieves a high efficiency, it is very hard to meet strict standards on color (50
Pt-Co) with only two treatment steps. Comparing the applied treatment technologies of
the Gi Tal and Ching Fa Companies (which have the same production process, raw
material input and use the same dispersed dyes), it is clear that Ching Fa Company has a
better working treatment technology than the Gi Tal Company. Using dispersed dyes
with one-step coagulation/flocculation, it is impossible to meet the standard as in case of
the Gi Tal Company. According to theory dispersed dyes can be removed with a
coagulation/flocculation process. In reality auxiliary chemicals (organic matter) are used
during the dyeing process; thus, the coagulation process only can remove color and only
a part of the COD. Therefore, the standard for COD (100 mg O2/L) cannot be reached
using the current treatment technology of the Gi Ta Company. As stated in Chapter 2, wastewater treatment significantly raises the production costs,
which is why most companies are not willing to treat wastewater. To save money,
wastewater is diluted by cooling water, condenser water and/or groundwater before
being discharged into the receiving water body, due to the low taxes for the exploitation
of groundwater and the fact that water supply costs are lower than wastewater treatment
costs. In addition, some companies are discharging wastewater into the environment
without treatment at night (from 7-12 pm) or during heavy rains to reduce the
operational costs of the wastewater treatment system. These violating strategies are
difficult to discover by environmental inspectors. 237 Table 7.6: Effluents of wastewater from seven textile companies in Nhon Trach 2 IZ

Source: Viet (2006) 238 Air emission Almost none of the textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ are equipped with waste
air treatment systems. Air pollution treatment consists of simply diffusion into the
surrounding zone through the installation of chimneys. Among the seven companies,
only the Hoalon Corporation Vietnam is equipped with an air treatment system, which
utilizes the wet absorption method. Table 7.7 shows the composition of the polluted
effluent air emitted from of some textile companies. These data show that in the three
companies without treatment systems, the SO2 concentration exceeds the industrial
emission standards TCVN 5939-2005. In the case of the Hualon Company, the
concentration of all pollutants discharged after treating meets the standards. Based on
annual environmental quality monitoring reports, all analyzed parameters of ambient
air, such as temperature, humidity, dust, noise, SO2, NO2 and CO, meet the working
environment sanitation standards of TCVSLD 3733/2002/QD-BYT of the Ministry of
Health and the ambient air quality standards (TCVN5937:2005) of the Ministry of
Natural Resources and Environment. Table 7.7: Composition of air pollution from smokestack of some textile companies Concentration (mg/m3)

hazardous solid waste and hazardous waste. Non-hazardous waste is divided into five
groups: scraps of yarns and fabrics; cardboard and paper; metals; plastics; and cinder
(ash after burning coal). The hazardous waste comprises six groups: sludge generated
from the wastewater treatment system; packaging material contaminated with chemicals
and oil; used fluorescent lamps; waste oil; cloths contaminated with chemicals and oil;
and left-over chemicals and dyestuffs. The monthly average mass of the industrial solid
waste from the seven textile companies is presented in Table 7.8. 239 Table 7.8: Monthly average mass of industrial waste generated from seven textile

(2006) In general, the industrial solid waste treatment of the seven textile companies can not
meet regulations of Vietnamese industrial waste management. At present, each
company has arranged a separate area for solid waste storage. However, hazardous
waste is not classified based on the regulations for industrial waste management.
Regarding non-hazardous solid waste, the companies have entered into a waste sale
contract with waste-purchasing private enterprises or scrap-buying companies. For
hazardous waste, some companies have signed contracts with professional companies,
such as the Tan Phat Tai Private Enterprise (Dong Nai), to collect, transport and treat
the hazardous waste. Other companies use local environmental service enterprises to
treat their hazardous waste, but these enterprises are unable to differentiate between
non-hazardous and hazardous wastes. Therefore, some types of hazardous waste are
sold to scrap-buying premises and the remaining hazardous waste is burnt or buried
together with the domestic solid waste. Only the S.Y Vina Co. Ltd carries out onsite
(and offsite) reuse. For example, the company reuses residual oil to lubricate the
cogwheels of the power-loom and for the sewing machine maintenance, additionally the
company exchanges packaging containers and chemical containers with suppliers. As noted in the general introduction, the textile industry attracts a large amount of
workers; the seven textile companies employ nearly 7,000 people. Thus, a significant
amount of domestic solid waste is generated daily from the activities of canteens and
offices. The average mass of domestic solid waste generated over one month for each of
the seven textile companies is listed in Table 7.9. The domestic solid waste is not yet
separated into recyclable components at each textile company. The companies entered
into a contract with an environmental service company for the daily collection of trash.
The waste is then buried at open landfills. In fact, the open landfills in the Nhon Trach
suburb are overloaded, creating pollution to air and water in the area. 240 Table 7.9: Mass of domestic solid waste from seven textile companies in Nhon

(2006) Monitoring environmental quality In accordance with the approved environmental impact assessment, twice a year the
textile companies should implement the environmental quality monitoring report. Each
textile company usually has a contract with a consulting company tasked with
assembling this report. The annual environmental quality monitoring reports of the
seven textile companies show that effluents from wastewater treatment facilities meet
the discharge standards (TCVN 5945:2005, class B) and the ambient air quality
standards (TCVN 5937:2005) as well as meets the working sanitation standards of
TCVSLD 3733/2002/QD-BYT of the Ministry of Health. However, actual surveys of
the seven treatment systems revealed that five wastewater treatment systems either were
not operating or were overloaded and wastewater was diluted or discharged directly into
the receiving water source. Hence, the completed reports do not reflect the real
environmental situation at these companies. This disqualifies the purpose of monitoring
reports, which can be a useful tool for competent authorities to direct environmental
control and can also be useful to help companies to improve their existing
environmental performance. The reason for the inaccurate reports is that the textile
companies specifically prepared their treatment systems to satisfy the monitoring
requirements, but after that reverted to their previous practices. In brief, the collected data and a practical investigation of the seven textile companies in
the Nhon Trach 2 IZ show that understanding environmental performance is still very
limited for these textile companies. Despite that, the companies have complied with the
regulations of the Environmental Protection Law by constructing wastewater treatment
systems and providing annual environmental quality reports; however, these steps are
taken only to satisfy the authorities. The wastewater treatment systems do not operate
adequately and the environmental quality monitoring does not reflect the real
environmental performance. All restrictions are related to an economic problem: the
costs for waste treatment are very high. To be competitive by reducing production costs,
the companies refrain from treating waste. Minimizing waste at source does not receive
due concern of the businesses because the law on the exploitation of natural resources
(groundwater) is weak and the inspection of the competent authorities (Department of
Natural Resources and Environment) is still limited. Moreover, with the strict discharge 241 standards implemented currently, it is very difficult for wastewater treatment system to
meet the standards for textile and garment industry and it requires very high costs for
both investment and operation. Therefore, textile companies have to find solutions that
reduce production costs and at the same time protect the environment. That is exactly
the aim of the industrial ecology concept.
7.4 Textile industrial ecology model According to experiments in the industrial ecology parks of Kalundborg in Denmark,
Brunnside in Canada, Riverside in United States, Fujisawa in Japan, Map Ta Phut in
Thailand and the Guitang Group in China, three main factors are facilitating the
development of an industrial ecology park: (1) one main industrial sector in the estate,
(2) a network of companies inside and outside the estate for exchanging waste, (3)
voluntary coordination of companies. To develop an industrial ecology model for the textile industry at the Nhon Trach 2 IZ,
the start should be in identifying and quantifying the material and energy flows through
the entire industry. After that follows the first step, cleaner production, which focuses
on one of industrial ecology’s main objectives and entails a radical approach to improve
the efficiency of using material and energy resources. The second step, to form a waste
exchange network, this encourages the reuse and recycling of almost all waste products
of the Nhon Trach 2 IZ. Finally, cooperation among companies in the industry will
promote the implementation of the industrial ecology idea or model on a voluntary
basis. 7.4.1 Cleaner production
As mentioned by Karamanos (1995), the industrial ecology concept is closely linked to
that of cleaner production. Both concepts focus on the general purpose of preventing
pollution and increasing the economic and environmental efficiency of materials and
energy. However, the difference between cleaner production and industrial ecology is
that cleaner production is conducted at the company level and industrial ecology can be
applied at the industrial sector level (Erkman and Ramaswamy 2001). As can been seen
in the case study of the Thanh Cong Company (chapter 6), cleaner production has
brought not only environmental benefits but also economic benefits. Many potential
savings are gained from relatively simple housekeeping, better process control and
material substitution options. Thanks to the implementation of the proposed production
options, the Thanh Cong Company can save 20%-45% in the flow rate of wastewater,
10%-30% for basic chemicals, 30%-40% of the amount of dyestuffs used and 10%
energy. These results are in line with VNCPC and VEA (2006), who mention the
following results from demonstration projects of cleaner production in the Vietnamese
textile industry. Fuel use decreases from 6%-57%, the amount of chemicals used is
reduced by 2%-33%, the electricity used is reduced by 3%-57%, wastewater decreased
from 5%-32% and the COD loading rate reduced by 10%-32%. During a visit to the seven textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ, it has been
observed that there was bad housekeeping and no formally arranged schedules; as a
result, raw materials were being wasted at these companies. These features show that
the textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ have much room to improve efficiencies 242 through cleaner production. The cleaner production practices of the case study at the
Thanh Cong Company can provide a practical guide for the seven textile companies in
Nhon Trach 2 IZ to decrease material and energy consumption. To identify cleaner
production options, data and surveys were collected and a calculation of the material
and energy consumption for the seven textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ was
completed. The rough calculations are based on the assessment of efficiency in
production processes by comparing the specific material consumptions of the seven
textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ with benchmarks of the textile industry in
other parts of the world and Vietnam. In this study, three indicators were selected:
specific water, fuel and electricity consumption. Each indicator is presented in more
detail below. Specific water consumption A comparison of the water consumption of textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ,
with benchmarks for water consumption established by the US EPA and with the textile
industry in India, is presented in Table 7.10. As reported in this table, the textile
companies in Vietnam consume less water than the standards of the US EPA, the textile
industry in India and finishing textile companies in Finland. The minimum specific
water consumption is 8.3 m3/ton for the US EPA, 25m3/ton for India and the maximum
is 392.8 m3/ton for US EPA and 60 m3/ton for India. In contrast, the consumption of
water per product unit of Vietnam’s textile companies varies widely, ranging from 10-
415 m3/ton (Loan (2004)). The input and output of water data from textile companies in
the Nhon Trach 2 IZ show that textile companies with synthetic yarn products have a
range of specific water consumption between 6.0-6.4 m3/ton. Blended yarn and fabric
products consume between 8.3-20.5 m3 per ton of raw material. It is obvious that
companies producing blended yarn and fabric may potentially incorporate cleaner
production options to decrease water consumption to the minimum specific water
consumption. The cleaner production options can be applied to the reuse of cooling
water, condenser water and washing water. The estimated amount of water that can be
saved is 36,650m3/month or 1,220m3/day. This translates into approximate annual
savings of 110,000 US$ (the price of water is 0.25US$/m3). As noted by VINATEX
(2003), water supply costs account for 15% of the production costs, so reducing water
consumption is synonymous with reducing production costs. 243 Table 7.10: Specific water consumption of textile companies in Nhon Trach 2 IZ

(2006) Specific fuel consumption The textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ use three types of fuel to operate boilers:
FO, DO and coal. The specific fuel consumption is dependent on the characteristics of
the boiler and usually varies between companies. The specific fuel consumptions of the
seven textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ and some textile companies around the
world are given in Table 7.11. Compared with the data of (Visvanathan and Kumar
1999), the specific coal consumption of the Hualon Corporation Vietnam and the
Namtex Company are higher than that of Thailand’s textile industry. The remaining
companies use FO/DO for boiler operation. When comparing the specific FO/DO
consumption for companies making blended yarn and fabric products in the Nhon Trach
2 IZ with Enviro Tex GmnH Company in Germany and finishing textile companies
(using wet processing) in Finland, the Nhon Trach textile companies consume more fuel
than Enviro Tex GmnH Comapny, but an amount similar to the finishing textile
companies in Finland. Three textile companies producing synthetic yarns in Nhon Trach
2 IZ consume less fuel than finishing textile companies in Finland with the same raw
material, but in comparison with Enviro Tex GmnH Company in Germany, these
companies consume slightly more fuel. Through the collected data, it can be seen that
the boilers of the seven Nhon Trach textile companies are citied to have new boilers
with low fuel consumption. However, there is no proper method for boiler operation and
employee management. This causes air pollution and human health concerns. Therefore,
it hinders the development of cleaner production options such as good housekeeping,
better process control and recycling. For instance, the reuse of hot washing water and 244 the recovery of condensate water to supply hot water for the boiler; the installation of a
heat and water meters for boilers; adjusting air inlets and oil regime to achieve optimum
burning processes; and recovering heat from the boiler and stack emissions. The
estimated benefit of these options is about 2-3 tons FO and 5-6 tons coal per day. The
economic benefit could be up to 2,000-3000 US$ per day. Table 7.11: The consumption of fuel and specific fuel consumption of textile

production of synthetic yarn and 0.5-4.9 kWh/kg for the production of blended fabrics.
The data in Table 7.12 show that the specific electricity consumption of the textile
companies making blended fabric products is higher than electricity consumption in the
Enviro Tex GmnH Company-Germany, but synthetic yarn companies consume less
electricity than the German ones. The electricity consumption of five finishing textile
companies in Finland was 1.4-7.5 kWh/kg. The wide range in electricity consumption
was due to differences in type product being produced. In general, the electricity
consumption of finishing textile companies in Finland is less than similar textile
companies in the Nhon Thach 2 IZ. The Choong Nam Company uses both electricity
supplied by the Nhon Trach 2 IZ and electricity supplied by its own generators, so its
electricity consumption can not be compared with that of other textile companies. 245 From data regarding the consumption of electricity for textile companies in the Nhon
Thach 2 IZ, it can be concluded that these companies can reduce electricity
consumption through some simple options such as rearranging the light system in
company workshops, replacing 40 W light bulbs with energy-saving light bulbs. These
companies can install capacitors to improve the power factor from 0.8 to 0.9 and boost
transformer loads to 80%. These options would result in saving 37,000 kWh of
electricity per day with an economic benefit of 2,300 US$. The dyeing method applied at some textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ is similar
to that employed by the Thanh Cong Company, which employs the exhaust method
using a jet machine. It should be possible for these companies to apply the same cleaner
production options developed for the Thanh Cong Company. These options should be
tailor-made according to the present situation of each company. The improvement of
housekeeping, better control process and the reuse of water and chemicals are the most
feasible measures to reduce pollution. Furthermore, the presently used chemicals and
dyestuffs can be replaced by alternatives that are better for the environment. In the long
term, new technologies with (semi-)continuous processes could be applied at most
companies. Among the four companies producing blended yarn and fabric products,
only Choong Nam Company uses a continuous dyeing process and its water
consumption is the lowest. Therefore, Choong Nam Company could achieve maximally
efficient production with relatively simple options, such as good housekeeping, better
process control, the reuse of water and chemicals and the substitution of dyes. Table 7.12: Consumption of electricity of textile companies in Nhon Trach 2 IZ,

Talvenmaa (2000) 246 7.4.2 Waste exchange network The next step of the industrial ecology model is to develop a waste exchange network in
the Nhon Trach suburb, which is also one of the pollution abatement and prevention
options. In the waste exchange network, a coalition is formed with various waste-
processing sectors that use by-product materials, upgrade them and feed them back in
the system. To develop the textile industrial ecology model at the Nhon Trach 2 IZ, the
waste exchange network should focus on four broad areas: - The transfer of raw materials from one process to other processes; a substance
that is a waste product from one process may serve as a raw material for another,
sometimes in an entirely different industry.
- The direct recycling of raw materials not completely consumed in the production
process.
- The utilization of exhaust gas generated from the operation of boiler to neutralize
alkaline wastewater.
- The recovery of energy through burning solid waste by an incinerator. Solid waste After the implementation of cleaner production options mentioned above, the amount of
solid waste decreases insignificantly, with the exception of sludge generated from the
wastewater treatment system. Currently, the amount of solid waste produced by textile
companies at the Nhon Trach 2 IZ is about 970 tons/month (reports on monitoring
environmental quality of seven textile companies from 2005-2007); and about 200 tons
per month of sludge from the centralized wastewater treatment plant (with a capacity of
5,000 m3/day) will be generated in 2010. These solid wastes can be divided into two categories. The first category is non-
hazardous waste, which is composed of five main groups: scrap of yarns and fabrics,
paper, plastics, scrap of metals and cinder. The second category ranks as hazardous
wastes, which include sludge from wastewater treatment plants, left-over chemicals,
fluorescent lamps, cloth contaminated with chemicals, waste packaging materials
contaminated with chemicals or oil and waste oil. According to the quantity and type of
wastes, two main waste processors have to be established inside the Nhon Trach 2 IZ.
The first involves a by-product enterprise and the second is a waste treatment enterprise,
in association with outside companies to form a waste exchange network in the Nhon
Trach suburb. Non-hazardous waste: industrial The amount of non-hazardous industrial waste generated at the Nhon Trach 2 IZ is
about 840 tons/month. The largest amount of the waste, about 750 tons, is cinder. After
implementing cleaner production options, the cinder is only decreased by a small
amount. The remaining wastes are not reduced. The amount of non-hazardous industrial
waste generated before and after the implementation of cleaner production at the Nhon
Trach 2 IZ is shown in Table 7.13. For non-hazardous wastes, a by-product enterprise 247 will have to be established inside the Nhon Trach 2 IZ; the technologies for reusing and
recycling non-hazardous waste are described below. Scrap of yarns and fabrics: All textile companies generate scraps of yarn and fabrics in
their manufacturing production. There are about 32.8 tons of yarn and fabric scraps
created each month; therefore, the capacity of the by-product enterprise should be about
1-2 tons/day. Recycling scrap yarns and fabrics could be applied as follows: -
When scrap fabric dimensions are larger than 1 yard, they are used to manufacture
cloths. Then the products are sold to consumers in the Nhon Trach suburb.
-
When the scrap of fabric has dimensions from 0.15 up to 1 yard, they are broken
into dust, which is used as stuffing in new toys or as a raw material source of paper
towels. -
Soft scrap yarns and scrap yarns with poor quality are used as material for making
mops. Recycling cardboard, paper and plastics The total generated waste cardboard and paper
is about 23 tons/month. The large cardboard pieces could be used to produce paper
boxes at the by-product enterprise in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ. Cardboard leftovers
(generated from the by-product enterprise), paper tubes, newspapers and office paper
could sorted at the station then sold for recycling purposes. In Dong Nai province, there
are four paper recycling companies. The waste plastics are composed of plastic bags, plastic cones and other plastic waste.
After collecting waste plastics, they are first classified based on their chemical
characteristics, such as PVC, PP, PE and HDPE. Then they are sold for reuse or to be
recycled into valuable products, such as plastic pipes, broomsticks, etc.
Pure metals are easily recycled; the recycling process commonly involves the reduction
of metal oxides to metal. As with plastics, metals will be classified at a sorting station
before they are returned to industrial consumers. All recycling activities (plastics, paper and metal) take place outside of the industrial
zone. Cinder The cinder generated after burning coal amounts to 75-80% of the total solid
waste generated at the Nhon Trach 2 IZ. The cinder is given back to the supplier or to
enterprises that produce combustibles. In 2007, the Dong Nai province had 27 industrial zones with different industries and 50
scrap business enterprises, meaning that a local market has actually developed for reuse
and recycling potential waste materials. All wastes, such as cardboard, plastics and
metals are sold to companies in the local market. For instance, waste papers are sold to
the Dong Nai Paper Joint Stock Company, the plastic waste is sold to the Dong Nai
Plastic Company and metals (iron) are sold to the Bien Hoa Steel Joint Stock Company.
In this way, waste materials do not need to be shipped long distances, which results in
decreased production costs for the recycling company and increase of benefits for the
textile company. 248 Table 7.13: Quantity of non-hazardous waste generate per month in Nhon Trach 2

Source: D2D company (2007) Non-hazardous waste: domestic Organic materials comprise 85%-90% of the domestic solid waste in Vietnam (Centema
2007), therefore, sorting at source is very important for successful composting
processes. Table 7.14 presents the quantity of domestic solid waste in the Nhon Trach 2
IZ. These organic materials have become a major material for composting plants in the
Dong Nai province; the composting product can be applied to soil in rubber tree or
cotton farms in Dong Nai province, which is one of three cotton cultivation
development projects of the Vietnam Textile Industry Group. Switching from chemical
to organic fertilizer (from composting products) in cotton cultivation is the most
environmentally friendly solution, because of reduced pollution and environmental
treatment costs. The remaining non-organic matter (10%-15%) can be classified and
sold together with non-hazardous industrial waste. Table 7.14: Quantity of domestic solid waste from textile companies in Nhon Trach

Tread (2006) Hazardous waste The hazardous wastes generated from textile companies are composed of sludge
(generated from textile wastewater treatment systems), cloths contaminated with
chemicals and oil, packaging materials contaminated with chemicals and oil and left-
over oil and chemicals. Table 7.15 lists the quantity of hazardous waste generated at the
Nhon Trach 2 IZ before and after the application of cleaner production options. The 249 total hazardous waste remains about 300 tons/month in which sludge gives the highest
amount (290 tons/month); the next is waste oil with 3,0 tons/month; then contaminated
packing material with 2,75 tons/month; and last, contaminated cloths with 2,72
tons/month. However, the Nhon Trach suburb does not have a hazardous waste
treatment plant. All waste must be treated off-location about 40-60 km away. According
to the Law on Environmental Protection (2005), each industrial zone has to install an
intermediate transmission station for normal and hazardous industrial solid waste.
Building a common waste treatment enterprise inside the Nhon Trach 2 IZ will suit the
development of industrial ecology. The capacity of the enterprise design should be
about 300 tons/month or 10 tons/day. This enterprise would not only help the industrial
zone comply with the environmental protection laws but also reduce the hazardous
waste treatment costs for each company in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ, because transport
charges account for about 3%-5% of the waste treatment cost (VUC 2008) and heat can
be recovered. This enterprise will include three workshops: one for classification, one
for incineration and one for reclaiming sodium hydroxide. The wastes will be collected
from all companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ and the surrounding industrial zones; they
will then be transported to the waste treatment enterprise. The waste is sorted at a
classification area and then the valuable hazardous wastes can be sold to recycling
enterprises. The remaining hazardous waste is stored in a separate area to await
treatment. Incinerating hazardous waste at Nhon Trach 2 IZ.
Incinerators can be installed to recover energy and remove air pollutants. They have a
capacity of 10 tons/day (about 300 tons/month), in which the following amounts of
material can be treated: - Amount of sludge: 9.7 tons/day;
- Amount cloths contaminated with chemicals and oil waste: 0.1 ton/day;
- Amount of packaging (most mixed plastics) contaminated with chemicals and
oil: 0.1 ton/day. The recovered heat is converted into steam and the steam can be used to generate
electrical power using a steam turbine. Likewise, the generated heat from the boilers of
textile companies in Nhon Trach 2 IZ can be recovered, or sludge can be dried from a
humidity of 85%-90% down to 15%-20%: optimal conditions for burning (humidity of
10%-15%). The recovered heat of the wastes can be calculated. According to Metcalf
and Eddy (2003), typical heating values of sludge are:
-
Activated sludge : 21,000 kJ/kg total solids; -
Raw chemically precipitated primary sludge : 16,000 kJ/kg total solids. The reference of composition of dewatered sludge from a centralized WWPT of Loteco
industrial zone –Vietnam, which has similar characteristics as Nhon Trach 2 IZ
(Centema 2006) is presented below:
-
Humidity : 85%-88%
-
Volatile suspended solid (VSS) : 53%
-
Ash : 47%
-
Dry matter : 10%-15% 250 According to Tchobanoglous (1993), Robinson (1986) and Mortensen and Kiely (1997),
typical energy content of textile and mixed plastic waste are:
-
Textiles : 18,300 kJ/kg
-
Plastics mixed : 32,700 kJ/kg
The total heating value generated in one day of combustion of 10 tons of waste may be
calculated by:
- Qsludge = 21,000 kJ/kg x 100 kg/day (10 tons sludge with 10% dry matter contents 100 kg total solids) = 2,100,000 kJ = 2,100 MJ/day
- Qtextile = 18,300 kJ/kg x 100 kg/day = 1,830 MJ/day
- Qplastics mixed = 32,700 kJ/kg x 100 kg/day = 3,270 MJ/day
- Qtotal = 2,100 MJ/day + 1,830 MJ/day + 3,270 MJ/day = 7,200 MJ/day The formation of electrical power is estimated to be about 2,000kWh/day by using the
conversion factor of heat into electrical power: 1055.06 J is approximately 2.931*10-4
kWh. The schematic process of burning hazardous waste is depicted in Figure 7.5. Table 7.15: Quantity of hazardous waste generate in Nhon Trach 2 IZ every month

Tread (2006) 251 Figure 7.5: Schematic process of burning hazardous waste with recovery of steam
and hot water Reclaiming sodium hydroxide and starch inside the Nhon Trach 2 IZ As mentioned in Chapter 6, wastewater from the scouring and sizing step of the dyeing
and finishing process usually contains a high sodium hydroxide and starch
concentration. Textile companies do not like to recycle these onsite because of high
expenses and facilities needed. With separation of these wastewater streams and if the
recycling of these chemicals could be conducted centralized, it could be cheaper than
recycling at each company separately. The method of recycling sodium hydroxide
solution is a vacuum system (evaporation of sodium hydroxide) and starch can be
condensed to a sizing solution that can be used as by-product. In addition, the scouring
wastewater can be used directly as an absorber for the treatment of fuel waste gas from
the incinerator and boiler. Reclaiming waste oil outside the Nhon Trach 2 IZ Waste oil is produced at a volume of 3.0 tons/month; this amount is not enough to be
recycled efficiently onsite; it is more efficient to reclaim it outside of the Nhon Trach 2
IZ. Two kinds of waste oil are produced: waste oil generated from lubricants in
production processes and waste oil from boiler fuel. The waste oil is sold to the Toan
Thang Reclamation Company, which is located outside the industrial zone. The process
of recycling waste oil is shown in Figure 7.6. This technology combines vacuum
distillation and adsorption processes using clay as an adsorbent. This company is at
some distance from the Nhon Trach 2 IZ at a distance of 30 km. Its products are sold to
a brick production company as fuel. Chimney

a centralized wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) has not yet been built according to
the approved environmental impact assessment by MONRE. A WWTP with a capacity
of 5,000m3/day is under construction. Although the seven textile companies have
already built wastewater treatment systems, there is no company whose effluents meet
the discharge standards (TCVN 5945:2005, class B). According to the measured results
of the composition of effluent from this industrial zone, parameters such as color,
suspended solids, COD and BOD all exceed the permissible values of the standard. The
wastewater of the industrial zone is typical of textile wastewater; therefore, it is difficult
and costly to treat. The treatment technology has to have specific characteristics and has
to be adapted to the flow rate of textile wastewater. To overcome these problems, a
cleaner production approach would help to reduce the pollutant load and the flow rate of
wastewater at each company. Applying cleaner production, the wastewater flow rate can
be reduced between 20% to 45% (Loan 2004; VNCPC and VEPA 2006). Consequently
the total volume of wastewater from the industrial zone would decrease from 14,000
m3/day down to 9,000-11,000m3/day. As noted in the case study of the Thanh Cong
Company in chapter 6, the concentration of pollutants could increase with 5% to 10% in
the effluent if the flow rate reduction does not correspond to a reduction of pollutant
concentration. However, a small increase in pollutant concentration does not affect the
selected technology. Following the wastewater composition, the objective of water
reuse and the results presented in the chapters 3, 4 and 5, the centralized wastewater
treatment plant of the Nhon Trach 2 IZ is designed for a capacity of 10,000m3/day with
a combination of conventional biological, physical/chemical and advanced oxidation
processes. The scheme of the treatment technology is depicted in Figure 7.7. With the application of this technology, the effluent can meet the water quality
standards for reuse. Table 7.16 gives the standards for irrigation reuse water quality.

Waste clay 253 surrounding companies (500 m3/day for 100 ha at 0.5 L/m2) and to water the transport
roads inside the industrial zone (20 m3/day). In addition, the textile industry attracts a large number of people and, due to the high
housing necessity for workers; the textile companies often build dormitories nearby the
industrial zone. The treated wastewater can be also used for the sanitary system of these
dormitories and in the industrial zone (8,000 workers use about 240m3/day assuming
30L per person per day). The treated wastewater can be used as an absorbent for the removal of dust and fuel
waste gas of a boiler. The demand for water use is about 7,500m3/day for a waste air
treatment system as mentioned in the section above. In addition, the Nhon Trach 2 IZ is located in an agriculture area; thus, treated
wastewater that meets the water quality for irrigation can be used for irrigation purposes
in the surrounding area. Finally, the remaining wastewater, which amounts to 1,700m3/day, can be discharged
into the Rach dua Canal flowing into the Thi Vai River. Regarding the management of industrial waste, the generated sludge from the WWTP
has to be treated with a suitable technology because it can contain potentially hazardous
components. The estimation of sludge generated from a centralized wastewater
treatment plant with a capacity of 10,000m3/day is about 5-6 tons waste sludge/day.
Cost of sludge treatment in Vietnam is about 330-.440 US$/ton (MOF 2008; VUC
2008). Total cost for treatment is approx. 1,998-2,664 US$/day. If sludge is combusted
in the incinerator with energy recovery and air pollution treatment, the cost will
decrease from 1,998-2,664 US$/day to 736 US$/day with an energy recovery of about
584 kWh/10 tons per day as presented in section 7.3.2. In addition, sludge can be used
as raw material for compost production, if in the cleaner production the toxic materials
were replaced by non-toxic ones. In this case, sale of the produced compost is about 55
US$/ton (Dung 2008).

Biogas Figure 7.7: Scheme of improved centralized wastewater treatment plant at Nhon Trach 2 IZ 255 Air pollution Gaseous emissions have been identified as the second largest pollution problem for the
textile industry. The textile companies use FO, DO and coal as fuels for the operation of
boilers; therefore, the composition of air pollution mainly consists of SO2, NOx, CO and
dust. However, even these waste products can be used more economically by using
them for certain chemical synthesis processes. Table 7.17 shows the total loading rate
and flow rate of fuel waste gas for one month at the Nhon Trach 2 IZ.

TCVN (5939-2005) class A: Air quality: maximum allowable industrial emission
standard concentrations of dusts and inorganic substances and class A requirements are
the allowable concentration of waste air for operating enterprises. According to the Law on Environmental Protection (2005), if companies are located in
an industrial zone they have to install treatment systems for gaseous emissions. Among
the seven textile companies allocated in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ, there are only two
companies equipped with a treatment system because the investment and operation of
treatment systems are costly, especially the chemicals. The treatment systems of these
companies use wet absorption (scrubber) with sodium hydroxide solution as the
absorbent. Through the survey results of the composition of wastewater from the textile
and garment industry with cotton, polyester and blended (polyester/cotton and
polyester/vinyl) products, one can see that wastewater effluents usually have a high
alkalinity. For instance, the alkalinity of scouring wastewater of Agtex Company was
19,000 mg CaCO3/L. The wastewater from the scouring and mercerizing steps usually
has a high pH (> 11). For textile wastewater a large amount of sulphuric acid is used to
neutralize the alkalinity of the wastewater as a first step in the water treatment process.
However, the alkaline wastewater can be reused as an absorbent for treating air
pollutants of the boilers of the textile companies and treating flue gas (SO2, HCl and
HF) from the incinerator of hazardous waste treatment enterprise (the double alkali
method (Stanley, 2005). When applying this method not only SO2 is removed but also
the expensive sodium hydroxide solution is regenerated with inexpensive lime (Stanley, 256 2005). The reaction of treating SO2 and the regeneration of sodium hydroxide is given
in equations (7.1) to (7.3).
2NaOH + SO2 →
Na2SO3(s) + H2O (7.1)
Ca(OH)2 + Na2SO3 → CaSO3(s)+ 2NaOH (7.2)
CaSO3(s) +1/2O2 + 2H2O
→
CaSO4.2H2O (s) (7.3)
H2SO4 + 2NaOH →
Na2SO4 + 2H2O (7.4)
In the equation (3) gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) is formed, which has commercial value in
the manufacturing of plasterboard. The neutralization reaction is expressed in equation
(7.4). The total loading rate of air pollution and the flow rate of waste air have calculated by a
model for air emission inventories and control for commercial boilers using different
fuels (WHO 1993). Table 7.17 shows the total loading rate and flow rate of waste air of
the seven textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ. The results show pollution levels of
dust and SO2 that exceed the permissible values many times for the industrial effluent
standards. According to Table 7.17, the emission of SO2 is about 3,422 kg/day or 3,629
mg/m3 (detailed calculation in appendix 2). The allowable concentration of SO2
discharge is 1,500 mg/m3. The efficiency of gas treatment system using a scrubber can
range from 60-80% (Nevers 1995). At a treatment efficiency of 80% the SO2
concentration goes from 3,629mg/m3(table 7.17) to 2,903 mg/m3 and the remaining SO2
would then be 726 mg/m3 and thus meting the standard. The consumed and formed
products include: -  The amount of sodium hydroxide needed to treat 2738 kg SO2/day (3,422 kg/day
x 0.8): 3,422 kg/day following equation 7.1; - The amount of Ca(OH)2 needed to regenerate the sodium hydroxide solution:
3,165 kg/day following equation 7.2; - The quantity of formed gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O): 7,357 kg/day following
equation 7.3; - The quantity of regenerated sodium hydroxide: 3,422 kg/day following equation
7.2.
Table 7.18 lists the quantity of used scouring chemical (sodium hydroxide) at textile
companies. The amount of sodium hydroxide that can be reused from scouring
wastewater is 37,700 kg/month or 1,257 kg/day. Reusing the sodium hydroxide in the
treatment of SO2 saves about 188,500 US$/year (the price of sodium hydroxide in
Vietnam (2007) 0.5 US$/kg). In addition, the amount of sulphuric acid used to
neutralize the alkaline wastewater can be reduced to 1,539 kg; therefore, the sulphuric
acid costs are decreased by about 153,900 US$/year (sulphuric acid costs about 0.33
US$/kg in Vietnam, 2007). Each year, the seven textile companies will save 342,400
US$ operational costs of their wastewater treatment systems. However, to avoid the
production of large quantities of calcium sulfite, which poses a major solid waste
disposal problem and to reduce expenses, the double alkali method should be applied.
This method allows the regeneration of expensive sodium hydroxide solutions with
inexpensive lime and forms valuable products like gypsum. As calculated above, the
amount of sodium hydroxide that needs to be regenerated is of about 3,422 kg/day. This
corresponds to 3,165 kg/day calcium hydroxide. The price of lime is about six times
lower than the price of sodium hydroxide. 257 Table 7.18: Quantity of used scouring chemical (sodium hydroxide) at textile

Total reuse (20% in wastewater) 37,700 The system set-up for treating the exhaust gas generated from boilers of textile
companies in Nhon Trach 2 IZ is same as the technology presented in the case study of
Thanh Cong Company (Figure 6.5). This treatment system includes a cyclone unit and
scrubber. The cyclone is used to remove particulates and is widely used as the first stage
of dust removal. The scrubber is very efficient and can trap gaseous pollutants as well as
very fine particulate matter. The more efficient scrubbers use alkali solutions. In this
case, the source of alkali for the scrubber is the scouring wastewater and treated
wastewater. Table 7.19 presents study results from the textile and garment Agtex Company for the
reuse of wastewater to treat air pollution from boilers with a cycle of 11.5 hours/day and
average consumption of 50,000 L of FO per month. According to Table 7.16, the total
volume of wastewater required to treat 2,395,845m3 waste gas/day is approximately
7,200 m3/day. If the textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ have to pay the 0.25
US$/m3 for the water supply, they would save 587,000 US$/year by reusing wastewater.
The wastewater generated from the scrubber unit only needs to be filtered and adjusted
in pH before being discharged. When environmental performance is no longer a burden
for enterprises, the investment in pollution treatment facilities can be promoted more
easily to textile companies. Table 7.19: Specification of reuse of scouring wastewater to remove sulphur

By applying the cleaner production approach and waste exchange network for textile
and garment companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ, a textile and garment industrial ecology
model can be designed, which is illustrated in Figure 7.8. As the figure shows, this
model can satisfy the requirements of the industrial ecology idea with the maximum
recycling of materials, the reuse of wastewater, treatment of waste air and renewable
resources. Applying industrial ecology to the textile and garment industry would
minimize the pollution of textile industry activities for the environment, which would
help Vietnam’s textile and garment industry to achieve sustainable development. 259 Figure 7.8.: Textile and garment industrial ecology model at Nhon Trach 2 IZ Exhaust gas treatment system Chimney

drawing table into practice, a better understanding is needed of the actors and
institutions in which the network of companies is embedded. In this section, the
implementation of the textile and garment industrial ecology model in the Nhon Trach 2
IZ is studied through a triad network analysis of the role of actors and institutions. 7.5.1 Economic network In the economic network, the economic relationships of textile companies in the Nhon
Trach 2 IZ with external economic entities and institutions are analyzed. The analysis
concentrates on three main interactions: the first is the interaction between textile
companies, suppliers and customers, along the supply chain; the second encompasses
interactions between these textile companies and other textile companies via branch
organizations; the last is the interaction of these textile companies with credit
institutions and research institutes. Supply chain actors Raw material suppliers
In the manufacturing process of textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ, diverse
materials are used, including raw cotton, synthetic yarn, blended fabric and chemicals,
such as basic and auxiliary chemicals and dyestuffs. According to the Vice President of
the Association for Garment, Textile - Embroidery and Knitting An (2007), Vietnamese
cotton fiber companies only satisfy 30% of the raw materials requirement. In addition,
the quantity of Vietnamese cotton fiber has proved not to be stable and is low in quality,
so textile companies usually avoid buying Vietnam’s cotton fiber. As stated above, the
seven textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ are 100% foreign direct investments.
The raw materials and chemicals required to assure production inputs for these textile
companies are almost completely provided through their mother companies. Textile
companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ have to respond to their mother company’s set
targets related to production quality and capacity. Hence, raw material suppliers have
little influence on the environmental performance of these textile companies. Water supplier
The seven textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ have a water consumption volume
of about 14,000 m3 /day and are supplied from two sources: from private wells owned
by each company and from the Nhon Trach groundwater plant with a capacity of
10,000m3/day. Although Dong Nai DONRE forbids industrial companies to exploit
groundwater in the Dong Nai area, some textile companies still use groundwater.
Because these textile companies use a huge amount of water, they can significantly
reduce production costs by using groundwater for free. As the infrastructure developer
charges 4,590 VND/m3 water (approx. 0.25 US$ /m3) the textile companies use, to a
limited extent, water from the water supply network of the industrial zone. Because
groundwater is free of charge, textile companies seem not to know the quantity of water 261 used in their production processes and do not pay attention to water saving in their
production process. In addition, these textile companies use groundwater, cooling water
and excess water from the production process to dilute the wastewater before
discharging it into the receiving body. As mentioned above, to achieve Vietnamese
discharge standards, wastewater treatment costs are estimated to be 8,000-
9,000VND/m3 (approx. 0.50-0.56 US$/m3), so diluting and discharging wastewater is
cheaper than treating it. The infrastructure developer only controls the water quantity
supplied to companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ through the water meter, but they cannot
supervise the flow rate of wastewater at each company. For example, one textile
company in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ uses 4,500 m3 of water per day. With a water price of
0.25US$/m3, they will pay 1,125 US$/day, which is a considerable amount of money
for the company. However, if the company uses groundwater, the water cost is
considerably lower (200 US$ per day, as treatment costs of ground water is
0.044US$/m3). Only when inspection and control on illegal groundwater use improves,
companies will be motivated to become more (ecologically) rational in water use. Fuel supplier Fuel in the form of FO is a necessary input for production activities of all textile
companies and is usually used to operate boilers. Fuel costs significantly affect
production costs (15%-20%, VINATEX 2003). At present, the textile companies pay
more attention to saving fuel than to saving water, because the costs for fuel are higher.
To cut fuel costs some textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ replaced FO for coal.
However, coal produces more air pollution. The textile companies also negotiate the
quality of fuel with their suppliers to obtain coal with less sulphur concentration and
impurities, which increases the efficiency of boilers while reducing air pollution (SO2),
resulting in decreased pollution treatment costs. Facing high and rising fuel prices, the
textile companies will have to consider every angle to increase the efficiency of their
boilers. By increasing energy efficiency or using a cleaner production approach, air
pollution, especially gaseous emissions, will be reduced along with reduced fuel
consumption. But these kinds of improvements are not triggered by fuel supplying
actors. Electricity supplier
Electricity is supplied to textile companies from the national grid via the 103 MVA
transformer station of the industrial zone. The distribution of electricity to each
company is determined by a contract between the infrastructure developer and the
company. Currently, the power price depends on the service time during the day; at the
peak time from 16.00 – 22.00 h electricity has a stipulated price of 0.11 US$/kWh, at
norm time from 06.00-16.00 h the price is 0.05 US$/kWh and at low time from 22.00-
05.00 h the price is 0.02 US$/kWh. The Vietnamese government has not increased the
electricity price for production in the past three years and has at the moment the
cheapest electricity in Asia (Thanh nien Newspaper 2007). With the current power
price, foreign textile companies in Nhon Trach 2 IZ ignore saving electricity. According
to the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the power price will increase. Once the price of
electricity rises, the textile companies might be encouraged to use power in a more 262 efficient way. However, this is in the hands of governmental agencies rather than the
electricity supplier. Customers/consumers
The textile products of the textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ are sold on the
domestic and international markets. All textile companies are 100% foreign equity,
including investors from Taiwan (four companies), Korea (two companies) and
Malaysia (one company). A portion of the products of these companies is returned to
the mother companies and these products are then exported to other countries or
consumed in their domestic markets. Because of the low labor price and lax
environmental regimes, the production costs in Vietnam are lower than in the original
countries. The majority of consumers in Asia (both in these countries as well as in
Vietnam) prefer products with high quality at a reasonable price and they are less
concerned about production related environmental pollution. This means that both
domestic and foreign Asian customers hardly influence the environmental performance
of these textile companies. Only customers from the OECD countries might include
environmental performance criteria into their preferences for products, but a very
limited percentage of products of the seven textile companies currently find its way to
these markets. Horizontal interactions between the producers and other companies There are more than 2,500 textile and garment companies in Vietnam, of which joint
stock and limited companies (state-owned capital <50%) and private companies occupy
a large percentage of 76 %, the foreign direct investment companies (FDI) account for
18.5% (VITAS 2009). Dong Nai province, as one of three major centers of textile
production in Vietnam, houses 61 operating textile companies. The Hualon Corporation
Vietnam, Choongnam Vietnam,  S.Y. Vina, Namtex, Ching Fa, Co., Ltd. are classified
as large-scale companies, whereas  Gi Tal Sewing Thread Co., Ltd, Yue Kun Co., Ltd
are classified as small-scale companies. Most textile companies experience fierce
competition among existing companies, not only in the domestic market, but also in the
export market. Competition mainly relates to production costs, and that influences the
environmental performance. Among the seven textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2
IZ, Choongnam Vietnam Co., Ltd is equipped with the most modern dyeing technology
(a continuous dyeing method with a cold pad batch method), using technology imported
from Japan. Only a few textile companies in Vietnam are equipped with such
technology. The remaining textile companies use dyeing batch technology with an
exhaust method using a jet dyer machine. The quantity of wastewater and the
production costs depend greatly on the technologies used. As shown above, the specific
water consumption among textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ is not so different.
The Choong Nam Company has the lowest specific water consumption, giving it a
competitive advantage over other foreign companies in the Vietnamese market. In
addition, some textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ comply with the regulation
forbidding the exploitation of groundwater; other companies still use groundwater
sources. As a result, the production costs of these companies that comply with this
regulation are higher. As mentioned above, all textile companies in Nhon Trach 2 IZ
built wastewater treatment facilities using similar treatment technologies. However, 263 these treatment systems are not operated in an optimal manner because the treatment
costs are high and the enforcement and sanctions are lax when discharging exceeds
standards. To lower production costs, the dilution of wastewater by fresh water is
applied at almost all textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ as a solution for
wastewater. Regarding information exchange the following communication pathways are used:
There are some Taiwanese, Korean and Japanese business associations established in
Vietnam. It is also through these associations that contacts between textile companies in
the Nhon Trach 2 IZ and other textile companies in Vietnam are facilitated. Foreign
companies do exchange experiences with each other over issues of common concern
such as how to reduce waste emissions in processing production, improvements in
production technologies, good service of suppliers of waste treatment and
environmental regulations in Vietnam by regular meetings of these associations. These
contacts are thus more or less within nationality and rarely cross the boundary to
another nationality.
The textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ do contact each other regarding
Vietnamese regulations, but exchanges of information regarding production technology
and waste treatment technology is rare compared to textile companies with same
nationality. Technological secrets and competition may play are role in the relation of
different countries and companies.
Interactions with credit institutions and research institutes
Improvement in wastewater treatment facilities of textile companies often includes
capital investment. Capital limitation is one the most difficult problems of both
domestic and foreign textile companies. It is often extremely difficult for textile
companies to borrow money from banks, especially for investments in waste treatment
systems. The various local and national environmental protection funds (see chapter 6)
are too small and bureaucratic to relieve textile companies from their capital shortage
for environmental investments, both in treatment systems and cleaner production
methods. To improve the situation, the national banks must guarantee loans for the
pollution prevention projects of textile companies and the national or local
environmental protection funds should find additional sources of capital and improve
the administrative procedures for loans. The textile industry is seen as one of the most polluting industries. Therefore,
Vietnamese research centers, universities and environmental companies have been
involved in research on and development of environmental improvements for this
industry. For example, research was conducted on the removal of color and COD of
textile wastewater, the recovery of wastewater to treat air pollution and demonstration
projects for cleaner production. However, as analyzed in the case study of the Thanh
Cong Company (chapter 6), the role of special institutes, universities and environmental
companies in the improvement of environmental performance of the textile industry is
very limited. The textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ are no exception. They
receive almost no technology, equipment, information, training and services from these
institutes, universities and companies. 264 Through an analysis of the economic network around the industrial zone, it is clear that
the role of the relevant economic network actors in implementing an industrial ecology
model is limited. Only foreign customers and branch associations such as Vitas can be
expected to support the implementation of the developed model. Phuong (2002), Dieu
(2003) and Nhat (2007) came to the same conclusion in their industrial ecology
informed research on industrial sectors in Vietnam. 7.5.2 Policy network
Policy efforts to reduce industrial pollution in Vietnam have focused on developing
environmental laws, regulations and recently economic instruments. Formal regulation
by itself has not proven very effective in reducing industrial pollution in the country.
While there is no substitute for an environmental regulatory regime, there is a need to
assess what makes industry take environmental action. Hence, the role of the different
actors in the policy network around Nhon Trach 2 IZ is analyzed below (see Figure 7.9),
with special emphasis on the authorities related to industrial zones  (VEA 2009). Figure 7.9: State environmental management organizations related to industrial

through the highest legal document, the 2005 Law on Environmental Protection (LEP).
In case of Nhon Trach 2 IZ, MONRE has effect on the environmental protection of the
Nhon Trach 2 IZ via an appraised environmental impact assessment (EIA) report and
the supervision and inspection of environmental performance after approval of the EIA.
The Nhon Trach 2 IZ elaborated and approved the EIA report in 1997. The contents of
the approved EIA focused on environmental performance, building a concentrated
sewage system for the collection and treatment of all wastewater of the industrial zone
and monitoring (and reporting) environmental quality twice per year. September 30,
2008, the birth of Vietnam Environment Administration (VEA) based on Decision No.
132/2008/QD-TTg of the Prime Minister is the first specialized agency of
environmental functions to assist the MONRE unified management of environmental
protection activities throughout the country. VEA's pollution control division is
responsible for supervising and inspecting the environmental protection performance of
industrial zones with EIA reports approved by MONRE. However, the 13 persons
employed in the pollution control division cannot carry out all the necessary tasks in the
entire country. Hence, while the Nhon Trach 2 IZ did not perform according to the
approved EIA or even comply with the LEP, they did not encounter problems from
MONRE. At the provincial level, the Department of Natural Resources and Environment of Dong
Nai (DONRE) is the main body responsible to the People’s Committees (PCs) for
exercising environmental protection regulations and requirements at Dong Nai.
Presently, DONRE is responsible for appraising EIA reports, supervising and inspecting
individual companies with respect to environmental performance. In the entire Nhon
Trach 2 IZ, there are 24 enterprises, all of which have to make EIA reports or negotiate
environmental protection commitments (depending on capacity of each company and
type of industry as regulated in Decree No. 80/2006/ND-CP by the Government on
detailed regulations and guidelines for implementation of some articles of the Law on
Environmental Protection), which are then approved by the Dong Nai PC or MONRE.
Of the seven textile companies in Nhon Trach 2 IZ the EIA of two large companies
(Houlong and Chong Nam Co. Ltd,) were approved by MONRE and the EIAs of the
remaining companies were approved by Dong Nai People’s Committees. The approved
EIAs of the seven textile companies in Nhon Trach 2 IZ prescribe that high
concentrations of wastewater or air pollution must be treated to meet the environmental
standard, before discharging effluents into the environment. Until now, all companies
had their own wastewater treatment system, but discharged wastewater almost never
met Vietnamese standards. Only two out of the seven textile companies have an air
pollution treatment system, but both systems are unstable. All companies carry out
environmental quality monitoring and reporting, but these are not in accordance with
the frequency (two times per year) and contents of the approved EIA. DONRE is
responsible for providing guidelines and enforcing environmental protection regulations
to enterprises. It should be noted that DONRE pays attention to environmental
performance (including checking effluents from waste treatment systems, monitoring
environmental quality standards and solid waste management at all companies located
within industrial zones). However, they typically do not consider the production
technology. It is difficult for DONRE to verify the accuracy of the environmental
monitoring reports of these companies, especially as the number of companies and 266 industrial zones increases every year. According to the Dong Nai Industrial Zone
Authority, in 2007 the Dong Nai PC approved 34 industrial zone investment projects,
while 21 IZs with more than 671 enterprises have already been brought into operation
by 2007. If violations of the regulations are noted, environmental protection inspectors
administratively sanction those companies. According to governmental Decree No.
81/2006/ND-CP, sanction levels range for 500,000-70,000,000 VND/incident
(approximately 30 to 4,000 US$) depending on the nature and severity of the
enterprise’s violation. These low levels discourage enterprises from implementing
appropriate and effective cleaner production or waste treatment; they find it more cost
effective to take the risk and eventually pay the fine. In the case of textile companies in
the Nhon Trach 2 IZ, a lack of human resources and professional knowledge, as well as
inadequate inspection plans (in which companies are alerted before they are inspected)
means that DONRE falls short in adequate inspection. As a result, none of these
companies encounters problems with DONRE, but environmental pollution is
continuously increasing (Dong Nai DONRE 2006). The Dong Nai Industrial Zone Authority (DIZA) was established by the Prime Minister
and is responsible for the management of industrial estates and all enterprises located
within the industrial estates. DIZA belongs to the People’s Committee of Dong Nai and
has limited tasks with respect to environmental management within industrial estates. At
present, the division of environment management tasks between DONRE and DIZA is
still not clear. When a problem arises, enterprises need to find out which agency is
entitled to give an opinion in advance and which agency is entitled to decide. DIZA
needs to coordinate with DONREs to resolve environmental disputes and problems
caused by environmental accidents in the industrial zones. The Company D2D is the industrial infrastructure developer of the Nhon Trach 2 IZ.
The formal environmental management responsibilities of the infrastructure developer,
as mentioned in the LEP (2005), are: -
To supervise and inspect compliance with environmental protection
requirements by establishing investment projects within industrial zones;
-
To manage the domestic waste and hazardous waste collection system; sewage
collection and treatment system; and gas emission treatment system;
-
To organize environmental quality monitoring and assessment and elaborate
periodical environment reports to province-level specialized environmental
protection agencies;
-
To advise the management boards of the industrial zone on the settlement of
environmental related disputes between companies located in the industrial
zone. In order to do this, industrial infrastructure developers need to establish a major
environmental division within their organization, with sufficient human and financial
resources. However, the current practice is different. According to the industrial zone
environmental protection regulation No. 62/2002/QD-BKCNMT issued by the Ministry
of Natural Resources and Environment, the industrial infrastructure developer should
have completed (environmental) infrastructures including the installation of a
centralized wastewater treatment plant, when 70% of the industrial zone area is given 267 out for investment. However, the centralized wastewater treatment plant in the Nhon
Trach 2 IZ is not yet completed, even though 100% of the area of the industrial zone is
handed out. Furthermore, the industrial zone developer was lax in implementing the
monitoring environmental quality regime, as mentioned in the approved EIA. The
monitoring environmental quality regime in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ started only in 2006
and it is still not functioning properly. This non-compliance of EIA requirements had no
consequences for the industrial developer. In addition, the company investment in
infrastructure of the Nhon Trach 2 IZ still does not provide for an environmental
division; one mechanical engineer manages all issues related to the environment at
industrial zone. The policy network analysis shows that the government's appeasement in processing
infringements, the limitations in supervision, inspection and the perfunctory handling of
violations of environmental management agencies has lead to the poor enforcement of
environmental regulations. Improvements need to be made on many fronts. In the case
of the textile industry, regulatory adjustments need to be considered at various places.
For instance, the strict regulations on color and COD of effluents are 50 Pt-Co and 50
mg O2/L for discharge into water bodies that are used for potable water and 150 Pt-Co
and 150 mg O2/L or 50Pt-Co and 80mg O2/L for discharge into rivers that are not used
for potable water. It is difficult for the textile industry to comply with these regulations
with the current levels of treatment technology and hence it is not surprising that textile
enterprises dilute or neglect to treat wastewater. Proper textile wastewater discharge
regulations might help to prevent this. In addition, the tasks, responsibilities and power
of the Industrial Zone Authority with respect to environmental protection in the
industrial zone have to be clearly regulated, in relation to those of DONRE and the
Industrial Estate Developing Company. A better division of tasks, where the Industrial
Zone Authority is given larger tasks, coordination and responsibilities for the
environmental performance of (groups of) companies within the zone. For instance
cleaner production and waste treatment may help DONRE organizations to prioritize on
inspecting environmental violations outside industry zone borders, developing
environmental
protection
strategies,
developing
regulations
and
monitoring
environmental quality in local areas. The industrial zone authority together with the
infrastructure developer will have to play important roles in developing and
implementing industrial ecology models. This should be facilitated by stringent
application of environmental protection charges, fines and stringent supervision by
DONRE. When infrastructure developers will have to pay larges fines for wastewater
discharges, air pollution, water consumption, they will have to strictly meter the influent
and effluent of all companies and charge them. This will function as a foundation for
‘voluntary’ cooperation among companies in establishing an industrial ecology model. 7.5.3 Societal network
The textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ are located in the industrial zone and the
surrounding agricultural area. Therefore, the actors that form a societal network
interacting with the textile companies in the Nhon Trach 2 IZ include traditional social
organizations like the Women’s Union, Veteran’s Union, Farm’s Union, Fatherland
Front’s Union, Young’s Union and Party’s Union. 268 All wastewater from the Nhon Trach 2 IZ is discharged into the Rach Dua canal, which
flows into the Thi Vai River. With a high flow rate and high pollution of the textile
wastewater, the water of the Rach Dua canal has become seriously polluted, leading to a
degradation of fish culture areas along Rach Dua canal. At present, local residents claim
that Thi Vai has become a dead river due to the wastewater it is receiving from 10
industrial zones within the Nhon Trach suburb. The surrounding residents are affected
by bad smell and the low quality of ground and surface water. The representatives of
The Veteran’s Union, Women’s Union and Fatherland Front’s Union received many
complaints from residents and farmers on pollution from Nhon Trach 2 IZ, among
others on fish mortality in ponds and on the color and smell of wastewater coming from
the Nhon Trach 2 IZ. These organizations deliver the complaints to competent state
agencies such as Commune People’s Committees, District People’s Committees, Dong
Nai DONRE and Province People’s Committees at their monthly and quarterly
meetings. However, complaining residents have not received much feedback from these
state agencies. This reveals that the role of traditional social organizations is limited in
industrial environmental reform, especially in rural areas. Hence, we can see more often that households and citizens directly complain with state
agencies. Before 2003, a group consisting of 22 households submitted a complaint on
wastewater discharges to the Commune People’s Committee, District People’s
Committee, Province People’s Committee, the Dong Nai DONRE and MONRE. Mr Le
Van Dung at Hamlet 3 Long Tho village, recorded that after six months these
households received an answer from MONRE, stating that all companies in the Nhon
Trach 2 IZ are required to treat their wastewater to meet the discharge standards. They
did not hear back from the local or provincial agencies. In 2003, households submitted
another complaint about the building of a drainage system for the industrial zone
through their land. Their complaints resulted in inspectors of the Department of Natural
Resources and Environment Dong Nai asking the infrastructure developer of the Nhon
Trach 2 IZ to compensate these households and to have a completely centralized
wastewater treatment plant ready for operation in 2009. Research by Phuong (2002),
Phuong and Mol (2004), Dieu (2003) and Nhat (2007) report similar cases of more or
less successful of citizens complaints, although the number of such cases remains quite
limited. In article 54 of the LEP (2005), the State encourages communities to found self-
management organizations to protect the environment within their localities and assigns
the commune-level. People’s Committees are responsible for issuing regulations for
self-management organizations in environmental protection and to facilitate their
effective operation. Self-management organizations operate on principles of voluntary
service, joint responsibility and observance of the law. Based on this article of the LEP
(2005), the Vietnam Fatherland Front has gained more power and a larger role in
environmental protection activities. They are responsible for training and mobilizing
their members and other citizens to participate in the monitoring of Environmental
Protection Law implementation (as defined in Article 124 of the LEP (2005). The role of the conventional and new media in triggering environmental reform along
the lines of the industrial ecology model are not fundamentally different from their role
as outlined in Chapter 6. 269 7.6 Conclusion In the strategies for the development of the textile and garment industry until 2025, the
Vietnam National Textile Garment Group will invest in building many centralized textile
and garment industrial zones. The industrial ecology model approach can become one of
the key projects of the textile and garment industry. Obviously, textile industrial ecology
brings benefits in terms of quality, price and environmental protection. By putting the
industrial ecology model into practice, the Vietnamese textile and garment industry can
continue to compete with many countries in the future. Our case study of a textile industrial ecology model carried out at the Nhon Trach 2 IZ
shows that industrial ecology can make a valuable contribution to achieving sustainable
development. This model was planned in three steps. The first step, cleaner production,
applies to all enterprises in an industrial system. The second step is to form a waste
exchange network, in which a by-product enterprise, a waste treatment enterprise and an
outside wastes exchange network will have to be established. The last step is to reuse
treated wastewater for treatment of gaseous wastes, irrigation in agriculture (cotton
cultivation), sanitary systems and for watering plants and roads. In addition, some
outside waste exchange will have to be maintained, such as the reuse of plastics, paper
and waste oil. A successful industrial ecology practice not only depends on the effects of the
interaction between enterprises inside the industry but also the interaction with actors
outside the system. Among the triad network actors, the policy network actors play the
most important role in the implementation of industrial ecology. With respect to the
economic network, the pricing of natural resources, the role of foreign customers and
the Vietnam Textile & Apparel Association, Vitas, are important actors and institutions
for improving environmental performance. The role of actors in social networks seems
to be limited with respect to implementing an industrial ecology model in Nhon Trach 2
IZ. 270 Chapter 8 Discussion and conclusions 272 8.1 Introduction The textile and garment industry has made a remarkable contribution to the economic
development of Vietnam (accounting now for 9% of the total Vietnamese industrial
value) and employs a large labor force of 2.5 million people. However, Vietnam’s
textile industry uses excessive amounts of material and energy and releases large
amounts of emissions into the environment. The results of our survey of Vietnamese
textile companies and of our literature review show that wastewater emission is the
most polluting part of the textile industry, as it contains high concentrations of
pollutants (especially color intensity) and is discharged at large volumes. Some
remediation strategies have been developed and implemented in the Vietnamese textile
industry in order to protect the physical environment. The main remediation approach
concentrates on the application of end-of-pipe or add-on technology, which costs large
amounts of energy and chemicals. The result of this approach is often a steady increase
in production costs, which often makes these types of treatment unpopular in Vietnam.
To overcome the disadvantages (and also poor implementation) of end-of-pipe
treatment approaches, experiments have been launched in the Vietnamese textile
industry with the application of other measures and strategies, such as cleaner
production (CP) and certified environmental management systems (e.g. ISO 14000).
However, after experimenting with these solutions for many years the number of
enterprises that have implemented cleaner production measures and have obtained ISO
14000 certification is still very limited. Although Vietnam has set up an environmental
administration and developed laws, policies and instruments to combat and prevent
industrial discharges and to protect the environment against industrial pollution, the
policy system seems unable to keep pace with the rapid development of the industry,
resulting in the continuing poor environmental performance of Vietnamese industries in
general and textile companies in particular. As a consequence the natural environment
has been and continues to be seriously destroyed in many geographical areas. The
textile industry is seen as one of the most polluting and unsustainable industries in
contemporary Vietnam In highly industrialized countries several pollution prevention approaches have been
developed and put into practice, among which a variety of end-of-pipe approaches,
cleaner production measures, waste exchange strategies and industrial ecology models.
These approaches are applied in order to treat existing waste streams, to prevent waste
and maximize pollution reduction at location (cleaner production), to optimize the
material and energy flows going through the industrial system (industrial ecology), and
to exchange by-products amongst companies on and off site. However, different
circumstances require different (combinations of) approaches to effectively protect the
environment and the approaches and technologies developed for developed countries
are not automatically suited or the best for the conditions of industrializing Vietnam.
This thesis assessed existing approaches known from developed countries and evaluated
whether and how these approaches can and should be adapted in order to make them
relevant for the current conditions of the Vietnamese textile industry. In the end the
thesis developed a model for greening production of individual textile companies and a
cluster of textile companies, by combining end-of-pipe, cleaner production, waste
exchange and reuse/recycling. Moreover the thesis has looked not only into the
technological and environmental science dimensions of such improvements, but also 273 into the actor networks that might, can or should play a role in governing the
implementation of these various approaches in Vietnam’s textile sector. This chapter first discusses the findings from the various chapters in the next section.
Subsequently it draws the main conclusions from the study. In the final section
recommendations are formulated for the practice of greening textile production in
contemporary Vietnam, as well as for future research into the technological and
management aspects of the environmental performance of textile production in
Vietnam.
8.2 Discussion
In order to move to a more sustainable textile industry in Vietnam the textile sector and
the Vietnamese government need to seek new approaches to improve its environmental
performance and safeguard its future market and license to produce. This thesis has
investigated options for creating a more sustainable textile sector along two major lines:
improvement of end-of-pipe treatment and of pollution prevention strategies. Both are
discussed and evaluated below. 8.2.1 End of pipe
At present, the majority of local authorities in Vietnam refuses new investments of
textile companies in their local area because this industry sector is seen as a major
pollution source. Textile wastewater is characterized by a complex composition
containing various organic compounds. The composition of the wastewater of 29
investigated textile enterprises in Vietnam was found to be more or less similar as the
composition reported in the international literature. The COD shows a wide range: from
250 to over 11,000mg O2/L, depending on the type of products and quality of chemicals
and dyestuffs. The ratio of BOD5/COD is often around 0.2-0.5. One of the important
characteristics of dyeing wastewater is the fact that it contains a high color intensity:
500-3,700 Pt-Co. Thus, wastewater treatment is an indispensable part of measures to
reduce environmental pollution. To design a complete treatment system – with effluent
meeting discharge regulations, reuse/recycling and low costs – this thesis looked into
separating wastewater streams and treating these with single treatment processes and
with combinations of physical, chemical and biological processes.
Separation of wastewater streams
In wet processes, 75% of the total water consumption is used for washing/rinsing
processes. Most rinsing steps are characterized by high water consumption and a low
effluent pollution concentration. The separation of wastewater streams enables optimal
treatment of each waste stream, the reuse of water and chemicals and it especially
reduces the operational costs. Similar results are also found in reports of Mattioli et al.
(2002) and Rott (2003). In the case of the 28 Company-Agtex (Chapter 5), an average of 700 m3/day of
wastewater was generated of which 130 m3 water and 10 m3 of 45% NaOH solution can
be saved. About 350 m3 of wastewater shows good biodegradability. Only 40 m3 of
wastewater has a high color intensity and high COD which needs special treatment.
Separation of wastewater streams saves 122 US$/day or 0.244 US$/m3. 274 However, for existing textile companies in Vietnam the separation of wastewater
streams is often not suitable because adaptation of the drainage system is expensive.
This approach is more suited for new companies and for those located in an industrial
zone. In an industrial zone, with application of separating wastewater streams, the
individual textile companies do not need to construct pre-treatment systems at their own
company. This brings financial benefits through lower operational costs and saves land
area.
Individual processes (physical/chemical processes)
Physical/chemical treatment processes for four types of wastewater were experimentally
tested. The Fenton’s reagent and the coagulation process are the most effective methods
for removal of color (81-98%) and COD (53-80%) for the four types of textile
wastewater, while the ozone process is significantly affected by particles (colloidal) in
textile wastewater.  Fenton’s reagent
The Fenton’s reagent process is the most effective method for color and COD removal
in comparison with the coagulation and ozone process. Decolorization with Fenton’s
reagent occurs through two mechanisms: oxidation by hydroxyl radicals and co-
precipitation through the coagulation with Fe(OH)3. This process can be applied to treat
both soluble and insoluble dyestuffs. These results are in agreement with research of
Kuo (1992) and Bharat and Sanjeev (2007). Fenton’s reagent is an effective and
economic method for decolorization and COD removal of several dye wastewaters.
Comparing treatment costs of Fenton’s reagent with the costs of coagulation with
aluminum sulfate for disperse & reactive dyes and vat dyes wastewater, Fenton’s
reagent proves cheaper than coagulation. However, for wastewater with a high COD
concentration, like disperse & acid dyes wastewater, a high concentration of oxidant is
needed. Because the H2O2 oxidant in Fenton’s reagent is more expensive than the
aluminum sulfate in the coagulation process, the treatment of high COD loaded
wastewaters with Fenton’s reagent is economically less favorable.  Ozone process The results from our research into ozone treatment processes are in agreement with the
international literature that concludes that the ozonation process is very effective for
treatment of direct, acid and reactive dyes (soluble dyes) while disperse and vat dyes
(insoluble dyes) are more resistant (Marmagn and Coste. 1996; Oliver et al. 2000). In this thesis, the effect of (colloidal) particles in the ozone process was studied for
artificial wastewater of the Aalten Textile Company in the Netherlands and real
wastewater streams from 28 Company-Agtex. It was found that particles significantly
affect the ozone process in a negative way, with consequences for the dosage of ozone
needed to reach a certain removal efficiency. The presence of colloidal particles alone
caused a 12 fold increase in ozone needed for the same removal efficiency. This effect
of particles has not yet been reported in the literature. There are some differences between the international literature and the findings in this
study regarding the results of ozone treatment. In a low pH environment, the direct 275 oxidation by molecular ozone is the prevalent process of oxidation; at higher pH this
would be by hydroxyl radicals. In this study we found with ozone treatment at low pH
that molecular ozone is much more selective than hydroxyl radicals in the
decolorization of dyes. The oxidation process did not improve the BOD5/COD ratio.
The azo-linkage is the easiest to break by oxidation, leading to decolorization. However,
the cleaved products of oxidation are apparently not more easily biodegradable. In
general it can be stated that Advanced Oxidation Processes are not economically
effective for treating highly COD loaded wastewater streams.  Coagulation process
The high removal efficiencies of the coagulation process in this research are similar to
results found in the literature. The removal efficiency depends on the type of used
dyestuffs. In several reported researches (Tünay et al. 1996; Vandevivere et al. 1998;
Oliver et al. 2000; Kao et al. 2001) the coagulation process is found effective in color
removal of insoluble dyestuffs such as disperse, azoic, vat and sulphur dyes, but low in
efficiency for soluble dyes. In this study the coagulation process achieved the highest
color removal efficiency (98%) with the insoluble vat dyes wastewater compared with
other wastewater streams (disperse & reactive dyes, disperse & acid dyes wastewater).
For wastewater containing soluble acid dye the coagulation process shows a much lower
color removal efficiency of 12-55%. This is agreement with the results of Tünay et al.
(1996). With a mix of insoluble dyes and soluble dyes (the disperse & reactive dyes and
the disperse & acid dyes wastewater) the removal efficiency depends on the ratio of
types of dyes (maximum removal efficiency 78-80%). The pH was found to affect the
coagulation process significantly. Among three coagulants, aluminum sulfate is
relatively the most effective (and cheapest) coagulant in color removal (78-98%). These
advantages are confirmed by the research of Thakur et al. (1994) and Turan-Ertas
(2001).
Combination of several processes Although a single treatment process like the coagulation process or Fenton’s reagent
yields high color removal efficiencies, the color of the effluent does not meet the strict
discharge regulations and standards of Vietnam (50 and 80 Pt-Co). Therefore, a
combination of physical, chemical and biological treatment processes was investigated. The combination of activated sludge, coagulation and ozone processes yielded the best
color (45 Pt-Co) and COD (30 mg O3/L) removal efficiency at the lowest costs
compared to all other tested combinations. With the proposed technology, the
operational costs are reduced 2.3 times in comparison with average operational costs in
Vietnam at present. The operational costs of this combination are estimated at about 0.3
US$/m3. In this system the biological process, as the first step, was designed to remove
biodegradable compounds. With a removal efficiency of 70%, this step reduces the
chemical consumption in the next physical/chemical processes. The coagulation process
was the next step, eliminating the remaining COD and a part of the color, as well as the
effect of colloidal particles on the subsequent ozone process. The coagulation step
produces an effluent with pH 5. With the subsequent ozonation at pH 5 the
decolorization occurs with molecular ozone which is much more favorable than the 276 oxidation by hydroxyl radicals. The resulting effluent meets the standards for irrigation
and reuse. Kao et al. (2001) reported in a survey for 75 textile wastewater treatment systems in
Taiwan that an aerobic treatment followed by a coagulation process (and vice versa) did
not achieve effluents that meet the discharge standards for color. Loan (2007) reported a
survey of 50 Vietnamese textile companies and concluded that a combination of aerobic
treatment followed by coagulation (and vice versa) produced effluents that also did not
meet the discharge standards regarding color. Also the operational costs were high. In
the here tested combination of an activated sludge, coagulation and ozone processes
these adversities were overcome. 8.2.2 Industrial ecology models Two case studies have been performed for this thesis on the greening of textile
production using more preventive and reuse/recycling approaches: one with respect to
Thanh Cong Company and one on a textile industrial cluster at Nhon Trach 2 industrial
zone. For both an industrial ecology inspired model was formulated. The design of the greening of production model for the Thanh Cong Company (Chapter
6) was achieved via two stages. Cleaner production was applied as a first stage. In this stage the application of a variety
of cleaner production measures reduces the use of dyestuffs, auxiliary chemicals, water
and energy. These measures range from good housekeeping, water reuse, to better
process control, equipment modification and new technology. The total benefits
following from these cleaner production options in savings per day for the Thanh Cong
Company is 1,388 US$. This monetary saving is comparable to savings found in cleaner
production application in Western European, Australian, Indian and Chinese textile
companies  (Sakura 1995; Petek and Glavic 1996; Xie 1996; Fresner 1998).
Demonstration projects of Cleaner Production in Vietnam (VNCPC 2005) show that 30-
50% of all current wastes and emissions from the textile industry can be prevented at
source by a cleaner production approach. Although a cleaner production approach can help significantly in the environmental
improvement of textile industry, it is not sufficient to deal with all waste streams
according to the Vietnamese requirements for pollution discharges and environmental
quality. So the second stage in greening the textile production focuses on dealing with
remaining wastes. These remaining waste streams can be remediated through a waste
exchange network, both on-site and off-site, and through a treatment system of
wastewater and polluted air. In on-site waste exchange, the scouring wastewater and
treated wastewater from the wastewater treatment plant can be used to treat polluted air
in a system with wet scrubbers. The off-side waste exchange includes recycling
companies of fabrics, cardboard, plastic, etc. The currently existing water treatment
system at textile companies is further improved by a combination of activated sludge,
coagulation and ozone processes, which can achieve effluents that meet the discharge
regulations and requirements for irrigation water at relatively low cost. In addition, such
a system of treating the remaining wastes provides textile companies with the 277 opportunity of expanding their production processes without having to expand their
wastewater treatment plants. In analyzing the role of actor networks in the greening of textile production at Thanh
Cong Company it was concluded that actors from the economic network were of key
importance in pushing towards the implementation of (elements of) the designed green
production model. Vietnam is still favoring economic development and social stability,
which means that also for actors in the economic network greening issues will only be
incorporated when economic benefits are linked to it. This is especially the case for the
textile and garment industry, with its major contribution to Vietnam’s domestic and
export economy. Hence, the strategy focuses on the implementation of cleaner
production, environmental management systems (ISO 14000), market specialization and
modernization. In contrast, the role of actors and institutions from the policy and social
networks remained limited in the current situation of Vietnam. The main challenge for
furthering the implementation of industrial ecology models at the company level is
strengthening the development and especially the implementation of support policies
and of environmental compliance. In recent years many environmental policies and
regulations have been developed in Vietnam, such as strict regulations for discharging
wastewater and waste air (2005, 2008 and 2009), taxes on natural resources (2008) and
cleaner production strategy up to 2025 (2009). If these policies are to be implemented
strictly and come together with a reform in the environmental policy administration, the
policy network will be able to significantly contribute to the implementation of our
model of greening textile production. The design of the industrial ecology zone model for Nhon Trach 2 IZ was executed in
three steps. In the first step, the greening production model was applied to all textile
enterprises in the industrial zone. During this step the wastewater flow rate could be
reduced from 14,000m3/day to 9,000-11,000 m3/day, comparable to a daily economic
saving of 750-1250 US$. According to the development strategy of the textile and
garment industry, 2015-2025, new enterprises will anyhow prioritize investments for
new process technology with less water use. The second step consisted of the formation
of a waste exchange network, in which a by-product enterprise, a waste treatment
enterprise and an outside wastes exchange network is to be established. The outside
waste exchange network includes the reuse of plastics, paper and waste oil at recycling
companies in the neighborhood. Vietnam has a large number of small scale scrap
businesses and a local flexible market for reuse and recycling has already developed,
especially in larger cities and industrial provinces such as Hochiminh city and Dong Nai
province. This opens favorable conditions for a waste exchange network outside the
industrial zone related to textile companies and clusters. Hence, Vietnam has clear
advantages in implementing an industrial ecology model for industrial zones, compared
to Western countries (see also Van Koppen and Mol, 2002). The last step consists of the
design of a complete treatment and reuse system of wastewater. Wastewater effluents
can be used in sanitary systems and to water plants and roads inside the industrial zone
(with an economic benefit of about 190 US$/day) and for irrigation (for instance in
cotton cultivation). The treatment of polluted air, which includes a cyclone and a wet
scrubber system, reuses treated wastewater and scouring wastewater, which saves 7,500
m3 fresh water per day and 1875 US$/day. Hence, the entire operational cost of
wastewater and polluted air treatment systems when reusing textile wastewater can save 278 342,400 US$/year. Such economic benefits are also demonstrated in industrial ecology
projects such as those in Kalundborg industrial park in Denmark and in the Rotterdam
harbor area, the Netherlands (Gertler and Ehrenfeld 1996); in Guangxi city, China (Zhu,
Lowe et al. 2007); and in industrial ecology case studies of agro and food processing
industries in Vietnam (Phuong 2002; Dieu 2003; Khoa 2006; Nhat 2007). The analysis of actor networks around Nhon Trach 2 IZ proved that implementation of
such industrial ecology models are far from easy. State and policy making actors in the
policy network should play a major role in the implementation of the industrial ecology
model, but showed similar shortcoming as concluded in the case study of Thanh Cong
Company. With respect to the economic network only foreign customers and branch
associations, like the Vietnam Textile & Apparel Association, can be expected currently
to support the implementation of the developed model. Phuong (2002), Dieu (2003) and
Nhat (2007) came to similar conclusions in their industrial ecology informed research
on other industrial sectors in Vietnam. The role of citizens, non-governmental
organizations and the media (all part of the so-called social networks) was marginal in
pushing the greening of Nhon Trach 2 IZ along lines of industrial ecology. Phuong
(2002), Phuong and Mol (2004), Dieu (2003) and Nhat (2007) reported cases of more or
less successful citizen complaints that resulted in environmental improvements,
although the number of such cases remains quite limited, not unlike what was found in
this study. 8.3 Conclusions
The study reported here aimed to develop a greening production and industrial ecology
model to achieve sustainable development for the textile and garment industry. These
models have not only to consider the pollution prevention approach but also to improve
existing end-of-pipe technologies towards lower costs and higher efficiencies and
towards reuse/recycling of wastewater. The following conclusions are drawn from this
study.
8.3.1 Industrial ecology model for textile industrial zones
The development strategy of the Vietnamese textile and garment industry till 2025
mentions the construction of concentrated textile and garment industrial zones as a
measure to execute environmental protection programs. This development strategy is
most favorable for developing and implementing a textile industrial ecology zone model
in Vietnam. Such a textile industrial ecology zone model has been developed and tested
for an existing industrial zone, Nhon Trach 2 IZ, in Chapter 7. The model provides a
feasible and attractive new approach to sustainable development of the textile industry,
with an efficient use of resources and an efficient elimination of waste. Based on the
case study of Nhon Trach 2 IZ, a generalized industrial ecology model for textile
industrial zones is proposed in Figure 8.1. This abstract model involves five
components: textile companies, a by-production company, a unified waste treatment
enterprise, onsite and offsite waste exchange networks, and a centralized wastewater
treatment plant. Operation of this model is based on the beneficial geographical
proximity of spinning, weaving, dyeing & finishing and sewing plants of several textile
companies. Between these companies by-products can be efficiently exchanged. The
treatment system for such a group of companies can be more economically realized 279 regarding infrastructure and land use. This will reduce transportation costs and air
pollution from transportation, allow optimization of scales in infrastructure and valorize
waste and by-products through on-site and off-site waste exchange networks. In on-site
waste exchange, the scouring wastewater generated from dyeing & finishing companies
and the treated wastewater from the centralized wastewater treatment plant are used for
air pollution treatment systems. Organic solid waste, chemical storage drums, cinder of
coal, plastics, metal waste, paper/cardboard and waste oil generated from production
processes  are reused/recycled by actors and companies outside the industrial zone:
composting business, recycling business for containers (drums, tins and bins), coal
supplier, plastic recycling companies, metal companies, paper/cardboard recycling
companies and waste oil recycling company. The remaining part of the industrial zone’s
solid waste stream is treated at a unified waste treatment enterprise within the industrial
zone, which includes a sorting station, and an incinerator with heat recovery to produce
hot water and electricity. The centralized wastewater treatment plant treats the final flow
of wastewater that cannot be reused. To move this model from the design table into practice a proactive and well-resourced
policy actor network is essential, something which is lacking at the moment in Vietnam.
Foreign customers that articulate environmental demands, an active Vietnam Textile &
Apparel Association that supports its members and disseminates information on
environmental measures, strategies and approaches, and an active civil society that is
given more opportunities to complain and motivate companies and industrial zones into
cleaning up their business are important potential supporters to activate such a policy
actor network. 8.3.2 Greening production of individual textile companies
Greening the production of individual textile companies – inside or outside industrial
zones - includes a combination of cleaner production, external waste exchange and end-
of-pipe technology.  Demonstration projects on cleaner production in Vietnam and in
other developing and developed countries show that cleaner production options can
bring both economic and environmental benefits. This proves also valid for Vietnamese
textile companies as demonstrated in our case study of greening production in the large
scale Thanh Cong Company (Chapter 6). This case study showed that such cleaner
production options need to be complemented by end-of-pipe measures and waste
exchange in order to maximize the textile company's environmental performance. Of
the 2,500 Vietnamese textile companies more than 50 are large scale textile companies,
which have many similarities with our case study company. Hence, the results of our
case study have wider relevance.
The stagnating implementation of cleaner production projects in Vietnamese industries
during the past 10 years illustrates that the greening of industries does not unfold
automatically. The current (policy, economic and social) actor networks do not yet
trigger textile companies into ecologizing their production processes. In the case of
Thanh Cong, a large exporting company, the economic network (and especially foreign
customers) can be of major relevance to motivate the textile companies into better
environmental performance. More active and more stringent enforcement of
environmental authorities and wider opportunities for the countervailing powers of civil
society seem relevant for the greening of all textile companies. 280 8.3.3 End of pipe Although a large amount of waste pollution can be reduced with the prevention and
reuse/recycling measures of the proposed greening production model or industrial
ecology model, a substantial amount of wastewater and polluted air is still generated
from the production process of each textile company due to the complex characteristics
of the production processes (Chapter 2). The consequence is that end-of-pipe treatment
is indispensable to implement the industrial ecology model. Several treatment options
were investigated for different types of textile wastewaters. Investigating the various
physical/chemical processes for their potential of color and COD removal from several
types of textile wastewater showed limited success when applied as individual treatment
processes. Each of these processes could only remove one or a few types of pollutants
from the wastewater with the consequence that the effluents could not meet all the
discharge regulations (Chapter 3). Treatment combinations are investigated in Chapter
4: combinations of coagulation, AOPs and specifically Fenton’ reagent, ozonation and
aerobic biological processes are tested for treatment efficiency of mixed textile
wastewater. The combination of an activated sludge, coagulation and ozone process
yielded the best color and COD removal efficiency at the lowest costs compared to all
other tested combinations. For textile wastewater, difficulties in treatment and high cost
mostly arise from mixing wastewaters from different process steps that have a variety of
concentrations and types of chemicals and dyestuffs. The separation of wastewater
streams at each textile company seems a suitable measure for it facilitates treatment of
each wastewater stream separately in an optimal way, as reflected in results of Chapter
5. The separation of wastewater streams allows not only reuse of water and chemicals
resulting in saving of water, chemicals and energy use but also reduces the quantity of
the discharged harmful compounds. Even when the operational costs are not reduced by
separating the waste streams, it can still be an attractive option. In this way, undesirable
by-products (toxic compounds) that emerge in case of treating mixed wastewater can be
avoided. The source separated wastewater streams for textile industrial zones are
divided into four types, according to their characteristics. The experimental research as
discussed in Chapter 3 and 4 can be used for efficient treatment of each stream (see
Figure 8.2): -
Wastewater that is low in pollutant concentration does not need  treatment;
-
Wastewater that can be reused for scouring, and wastewater with high pH  that
can be used in the air treatment system;
-
Wastewater containing biodegradable pollutants, which can be treated by an
aerobic process;
-
Wastewater with high color intensity and high COD, to be treated with a
combination of biological treatment, coagulation and ozone as post-treatment at
low pH The proposed treatment technologies are low in energy and chemical consumption
resulting in low operational costs. In order to maintain a stable operation of the
treatment systems, pH and temperature control equipment have to be installed to
guarantee favorable pHs and temperature for the aerobic and coagulation/flocculation
processes, because the composition of wastewater can change considerably within a
day, or even an hour. 281 Figure 8.1: Textile Industrial ecology zone model Fuel  Water

are presented below, in relation with end-of-pipe technology, for achieving
reuse/recycling of wastewater, and for a textile industrial ecology model. 8.4.1 Recommendations for improving environmental performance
Although a number of textile companies have built wastewater treatment plants, the
pollution situation has not markedly improved. This is mainly due to a lack of
knowledge on appropriate treatment technology, a lack skilled of operators and high
operational costs. The Vietnam Environment Administration (VEA) should assess
textile wastewater treatment technologies and provide a list of appropriate textile
wastewater treatment technologies (including the proposed end-of-pipe treatment
systems discussed in this thesis). Such a list will help to provide adequate information to
textile companies for wastewater treatment approach. Besides filling this knowledge
gap, the limitations in supervision and inspection and the perfunctory handling of
violations of environmental management agencies have contributed to the violations of
environmental regulations. MONRE, DONREs and the industrial zone authorities
should thus strengthen the inspection and control efforts on industrial enterprises in their
locality. Such measures motivate force and guide the textile industry to implement
appropriate treatment technologies approach. Vietnam’s environmental policy-making started later than that in many other countries,
and is still in its infancy and incomplete. The policies of Vietnam are not (yet) able to
ensure an effective combination of three elements: economic development, social
development and environmental protection. In recent years many policies and
regulations in relation to environmental protection in Vietnam were issued, such as
strict regulations for wastewater and waste air discharges (2005, 2008 and 2009). For
example, to produce effluent that meets color (20, 50Pt-Co) and COD regulations (COD
50, 80 mgO2/L) requires modern treatment technologies, which are currently not
available. Assessing the both the currently available technologies and the
implementation of these regulations will help environmental management agencies
(MONRE, VEA) to judge the feasibility of national regulations for effluents of the
textile industry and to make it suitable for the conditions of contemporary Vietnam. In Vietnam, the awareness of enterprises on environmental protection is not very high
and one cannot expect that an industrial ecology model will be implemented
‘automatically’. In order to improve the environmental performance through an
industrial ecology model, textile companies should be brought together (as a sector or
with companies from other industrial sectors) in industrial zones and should be guided
by environmental authorities and industrial zone authorities on the advantages and
implementation trajectories of such models. There are many advantages to apply the idea of an “industrial ecology zone” in
Vietnam, especially when considering the targets and development viewpoints of the
textile and garment industry strategy until 2015 towards 2025, as proposed by the
government. In advancing an industrial ecology model, there is a need for coordination
between ministries (Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of Natural Resources and 284 Environment, Ministry of Finance) and provincial People’s Committees, as shown in
Figure 7.9. Establishment of a recycling association outside – but in close relation to –
the industrial zone can be expected to support the implementation of the industrial
ecology zone.
Policies in relation to support cleaner production are currently rather weak, while
policies in relation to industrial ecology zones, reuse/recycling and waste exchanges are
almost none-existent. The government should promulgate such policies supporting
cleaner production, industrial ecology, waste exchange and waste recycling.
To enhance the environmental awareness and role of communities, environmental
management agencies (MONRE and DONRE) can cooperate with the media to
disseminate environmental information more widely to people and increase the public’s
environmental awareness, also with respect to industrial pollution. Once environmental
awareness of citizens has increased, they will pay more attention to the negative impacts
caused by industrial wastes. As such the social network can not only become a useful
information source but can also help environmental agencies to detect environmental
pollution and enforce improvements. For that to materialize, however, structures for
complaints and participation for civil society need to be enhanced.
In the future, many concentrated textile industrial zones and cotton planting areas will
be established (Vinatex, 2009) and one of the solutions for environmental protection is
to transfer existing industrial zones into environment friendly zones through
implementation of an industrial ecology model (VEA, 2009). In that respect it would be
interesting to implement the demonstration project for textile industrial ecology as
proposed in this research.
8.4.2 Some recommendations for future research From the results obtained from this research some future research ideas are suggested.
A disadvantage of the aerobic process is the amount of consumed energy for aeration.
Therefore, the treatment efficiency for decolorization of source separated wastewater
streams (with high color and COD) with anaerobic UASB or EGSB processes should be
investigated. With these processes recovery of energy (biogas) and/or decrease of
energy consumption are possible. In addition, textile wastewater often has a high
temperature (50-600C), which is advantageous for mesophilic or even thermophilic
anaerobic processes. If treatment at high temperatures is not effective, it is necessary to
install a cooling tower as part of a proposed end-of-pipe technology. This may result in
a decrease of the operational costs and may recover energy. In our research and in the international literature it is found that the color can decrease
through an activated sludge process. Therefore, future study may consider the
absorption capacity of color on activated sludge, the hydraulic retention time and the
cycle of sludge. This study has mainly focused on large textile companies, both stand alone and in
industrial zones. Future research is needed on smaller textile companies and the extent
to which the approaches and measures developed in this thesis are relevant for these
smaller textile companies, in terms of the technologies applied; the cost structure; the
cooperation with similar and different industries in industrial networks, zones or
clusters; and the supporting networks to trigger the implementation of such strategies. 285 SUMMARY
The textile and garment industry has made a remarkable contribution to the economic
development of Vietnam (9% of the total Vietnamese industrial value) and employs a
large labor force of 2.5 million people. Additionally, Vietnam’s textile industry is in the
top ten garment exporting countries and territories of the world. However, this industry
uses excessive amounts of material and is responsible for emission of a large amount of
pollutants. Some remediation measures have been implemented in the textile industry
for environmental protection. The main remediation approach was focused on end-of-
pipe technology, which requires a lot of energy and chemicals, resulting in high costs.
The consequence is that the waste is often discharged into the environment without any
treatment. Due to these discharges the natural environment has been seriously destroyed
in many areas. The textile industry is seen as the most polluting and unsustainable
industry in Vietnam. To overcome disadvantages of the application of end-of-pipe
technologies, other measures can be applied in the textile industry in Vietnam, like
cleaner production (CP) and ISO 14000. However, the number of CP and ISO 14000
implementing enterprises is limited. The poor environmental performance in the textile
industry is related to the role of the actors in the industrial system, like the governmental
organizations, economic and social organizations. In the highly industrialized countries several pollution prevention approaches such as
greening production, industrial ecology and waste exchange have been developed and
practiced. These approaches are applied in order to prevent waste production and to
maximize pollution reduction at location (cleaner production), to optimize the material
and energy flows going through the industrial system (industrial ecology) and to
exchange by-products amongst companies on and off site. However, different
circumstances require different (combinations of) approaches to effectively protect the
environment. To suit the nature and the conditions in the Vietnamese textile industry
practice experiences from developed countries are selected to develop a greening
production model for individual textile companies and a textile industrial ecology
model combining end-of-pipe technology with reuse/recycling requirements. The
approach with these models can improve stability, sustainably and effectiveness of the
textile industry in Vietnam. In order to promote the proposed models in practice, the
theory and practice of a triad-network model developed by Mol (1995) is introduced
and analyzed in greening production, industrial ecology and end-of-pipe models. Two case studies, executed as desk studies, include greening production in an individual
company, and in an industrial ecology zone, demonstrate the economical and
environmental benefits of pollution prevention methodologies and models. The greening
production model is developed and assessed for a large-scale textile company in
Hochiminh city, the Thanh Cong Company. The model includes combining Cleaner
Production and external waste exchange. The benefits of the application of the proposed
model are the significantly decreased volume of wastewater and the reduced chemical
loads going into the wastewater. Furthermore, an external waste exchange network can
help to recycle most remaining waste materials, by reusing it as raw material in other
companies. The greening production model provided a feasible and attractive new
approach to sustainable development of an individual large textile company. To investigate the relevance of an industrial ecology approach for Vietnam, an
integrated model for an industrial zone, the Nhon Trach 2 IZ, is tested. This model is 286 based on a mutually beneficial relationship of the geographical proximity of seven
textile companies in the industrial zone and an external waste exchange network. The
proposed industrial ecology model can make a valuable contribution to achieving
sustainable development. This model was elaborated in three steps. The first step is to
learn from the experiences with the model for the individual Thanh Cong Company, and
apply these to all enterprises in an industrial zone. The second step is to form a waste
exchange network, in which a by-product using enterprise, a waste treatment enterprise
and an outside wastes exchange network have to be established. The last step is to treat
waste, polluted air and to treat and reuse wastewater (using the results from Chapters 3,
4 and 5) for irrigation (cotton cultivation), for use in sanitary systems and to water
plants and roads in the industrial zone. In addition, some outside waste exchange has to
be set-up for the reuse of waste plastics, waste paper and waste oil. Cleaner production and industrial ecology approaches can help environmental
improvement in industry, but is not sufficient to deal with all waste streams. The results
of the survey and of the literature review show that the wastewater, containing high
concentrations of pollutants (especially color intensity) and characterized by a large
volume, is the most polluting part of the textile industry. Color intensity is considered as one of the key parameters in the treatment of textile
wastewater. Removal of color from textile wastewater was studied. This part of the
research was focused on the reduction of color by varying the pH, by application of
coagulation/flocculation and advanced oxidation processes (O3, O3/H2O2, Fenton’s
reagent). The experimental tests were performed with real wastewater streams (disperse
& reactive dyes, vat dyes, disperse & acid dyes, mixed wastewater and acid dyes
wastewater) from a textile company in Vietnam (28 Company-Agtex), from Belgium
(UCO textile factory, Gent) and with an artificial wastewater prepared according to a
recipe of the GVA Textile Company in Aalten, the Netherlands. Fenton’s reagent is the
most effective method for color removal of the four types of wastewater. The
coagulation process is a very effective means for color removal of four types of
wastewater, but this process is not suited for wastewater containing only soluble
dyestuffs. For the decolorization of wastewater with the ozone process at low pH value
(pH 5) the direct oxidation by molecular ozone was found to be much more selective
than the oxidation by hydroxyl radicals. The O3/H2O2 process gave the lowest removal
efficiency in comparison with ozone and Fenton’s reagent.
Changing the pH gave no decolorization. The effect of different acids (HCl and H2SO4)
on the change of color was more or less the same.
Temperatures in the range between 30 and 500C have a small effect on the coagulation
process. For AOPs at high temperature (500C) causes decrease efficiency in comparison
with 300C and 400C.
The physical/chemical processes like pH variation, coagulation, and AOPs, for
treatment of textile wastewater have limited success as individual treatment processes.
Each of these treatment processes could only remove one or a few types of pollutants
from the wastewater with the consequence that the effluents could not meet all the
discharge regulations. Therefore combinations of several processes were investigated to
achieve an effluent that meets the strict discharge regulations for color and COD (50 Pt-
Co and 50 mg O2/L). Combinations of coagulation, AOPs and biological processes (and
vice versa) were tested for treatment efficiency of mixed textile wastewater. The 287 combination of an activated sludge, coagulation and ozone process yielded the best
color and COD removal efficiency at the lowest costs compared to all other tested
combinations. In the wet processes applied in the textile industry, 75% of the total water consumption
is used for washing/rinsing processes. Difficulties in the treatment of textile wastewater
and costs mostly arise from mixing wastewaters from different process steps that have a
variety of concentrations and types of chemicals and dyestuffs.  Additionally, most
rinsing steps contain low pollution concentrations and can be reused in other process
stages or can be discharged without treatment. The aim of this part of the study was to
assess the possibilities for wastewater separation in practice by investigating wastewater
source separation at the 28 Company – Agtex. The total wastewater flow of this
company averages at 700 m3/day of which 130 m3 of water and 10 m3 of  NaOH
solution can be saved. About 350 m3 of wastewater has a good biodegradability. Only
40 m3 of the wastewater has a high color intensity and COD which needs special
treatment. The separation of wastewater streams can save 122 US$/day or 0.244
US$/m3. The results show that the separation of wastewater streams allows not only the
reuse of water and chemicals, but it also increases the efficiency of treatment since each
separate wastewater stream can be treated in an optimal way.
Analyzing triad-network in the case study of the greening production, industrial ecology
zone model, shows that a successful industrial ecology in practice not only depends on
the interaction between enterprises inside the industrial zone but also on the interaction
with actors outside the system. Effects of actor networks will depend on the nature of
and condition in each company or industry. In the case of Thanh Cong, a large export
company, the economic network is of major importance: e.g. the customers. A social
network can also affect a commercial company via the use of mass media and change
the behavior of the polluters. These networks contribute to implement the model.
However, the role of the policy network is still limited in the current settings of Vietnam
due to a number of flaws at national and local level. In the case study of an industrial
ecology zone, the policy network plays the most important role in the implementation of
the industrial ecology model. With respect to the economic network, the role of foreign
customers and the Vietnam Textile & Apparel Association are important actors for
improving environmental performance. The role of social networks actors seems to be
limited at present. This is due to state priorities and the state’s environmental policy is
based on a top-down model. Besides that the environmetal awarence of citizents is low.
The greening production, industrial ecology, waste exchange and end-of-pipe models
can only go successfully into practice when having the combination of the two aspects:
technology and triad-network. 288 289 SAMENVATTING
De kleding- en textielindustrie in Vietnam heeft in aanzienlijke mate bijgedragen aan
de economische ontwikkeling van het land. De economische waarde van de kleding- en
textielindustrie bedraagt momenteel ongeveer 9 % van de totale waarde van de
industriële productie in Vietnam. Het aantal werknemers in deze industrietak bedraagt
ongeveer 2,5 miljoen. Vietnam behoort tot de top van de kleding en textiel
exporterende landen en regio’s. Echter, deze industrietak gebruikt grote hoeveelheden
grondstoffen
en
is
verantwoordelijk
voor
aanzienlijke
emissies
van
milieuverontreinigende stoffen. Een aantal maatregelen om de milieuverontreiniging
terug te dringen is inmiddels genomen. Deze maatregelen betreffen vooral de
toepassing van end-of-pipe technologie en worden gekenmerkt door een hoog gebruik
van energie en grondstoffen hetgeen weer gepaard gaat met hoge kosten. Het gevolg is
dat afval en afvalwater momenteel vaak zonder enige behandeling worden gedumpt in
het milieu waardoor veel gebieden onherstelbaar zijn verontreinigd. De textielindustrie
in Vietnam wordt dan ook beschouwd als de meest vervuilende en meest onduurzame
industrietak in Vietnam. Om de nadelen van het uitsluitend toepassen van end-of-pipe
technologie te voorkómen, zijn ook andere maatregelen ingevoerd, zoals schoner
produceren en toepassing van milieumanagement systemen, zoals die gecertificeerd
zijn door ISO 14000. Het blijkt echter dat ook na het invoeren van deze maatregelen het
aantal bedrijven, dat deze maatregelen daadwerkelijk heeft geïmplementeerd, toch zeer
beperkt is gebleven. De zwakke prestaties van de textielindustrie op milieugebied
worden o.a. toegeschreven aan de rol die de betrokken actoren in Vietnam, zoals
overheidsinstanties, economische en sociaal/maatschappelijke organisaties, vervullen in
het industriële productiesysteem. In de hoog geïndustrialiseerde landen zijn verschillende typen preventiemaatregelen
geïmplementeerd om milieuverontreiniging te verminderen. Als belangrijkste
maatregelen kunnen worden genoemd de vergroening van het productieproces, de
toepassing van industriële ecologie, en geïntegreerde afvalverwerking in samenwerking
met andere industrietakken, waaronder ook specifieke verwerkers van afval, gericht op
nuttig hergebruik van grondstoffen en energie. Deze aanpak wordt toegepast om het
ontstaan van afval te voorkómen en de reductie van emissies op de productielocatie te
minimaliseren (schone productie), om het gebruik van grondstoffen en energie bij het
industriële productieproces te minimaliseren (industriële ecologie) en om het nuttig
gebruik van afvalstromen door andere bedrijven binnen of buiten de industriële locatie
te bevorderen. Echter, verschillen in omstandigheden en situaties vragen ook om
verschillen in aanpak om effectief het milieu te beschermen.
Praktijkervaringen, opgedaan in de geïndustrialiseerde landen zijn geselecteerd om een
vergroeningsmodel voor individuele Vietnamese textielbedrijven te ontwerpen alsmede
een industrial ecology model te ontwikkelen voor de Vietnamese textielindustrie in het
algemeen, waarbij end-of-pipe technologie gecombineerd wordt met schone productie,
hergebruik en recycling en waarbij tevens rekening wordt gehouden met de specifieke
aard en omstandigheden van de Vietnamese textielindustrie. De aanpak door middel van
deze modellen maakt het mogelijk de stabiliteit, milieuhygiënische duurzaamheid en
effectiviteit van de textielindustrie in Vietnam verbeteren. Teneinde de toepassing van
de voorgestelde modellen in de praktijk te bevorderen wordt de theorie en 290 praktijktoepassing van een zogenaamd triad-network, ontwikkeld door Mol (1995),
gebruikt voor de analyse van de  vergroening van het productieproces, de toepassing
van industrial ecology en end-of-pipe toepassingen.
De economische en milieuhygiënische verdiensten van de toepassing van
preventiemethoden voor milieuvervuiling worden gedemonstreerd door middel van een
tweetal casestudies. Een van de casestudies heeft betrekking op de vergroening van het
productieproces van een individueel Vietnamees textielbedrijf, de Thanh Cong
Company; de andere heeft betrekking op de gezamenlijke textielindustrie in een
industriële zone, de Nhon Trach 2 IZ. Het vergroeningsmodel is ontwikkeld, toegepast
en geëvalueerd voor de Thanh Cong Company, een groot textielbedrijf in Hochiminh
City. Het model combineert in feite schone productie en duurzame externe verwerking
van afvalstromen. De verdiensten die het model illustreert, zijn een aanzienlijke
vermindering van de hoeveelheid geproduceerd afvalwater alsmede een sterke
vermindering van de hoeveelheid vervuilende componenten in dit afvalwater. Het
model toont tevens aan dat de toepassing van een extern netwerk voor een duurzame
verwerking van afvalstromen resulteert in recycling van de meeste materialen die in
deze afvalstromen aanwezig zijn, middels nuttig hergebruik in andere bedrijven. In het
algemeen demonstreren de resultaten van deze casestudies de economische en
milieuhygiënische verdiensten van de toepassing van preventie van milieuvervuiling en
van industriële ecologie in een groot Vietnamees textielbedrijf. Het bestudeerde model
voor vergroening van de productie kan worden beschouwd als een haalbare en
attractieve methode om individuele textielbedrijven duurzaam te maken. Om de relevantie van een industrial ecology benadering voor Vietnam te onderzoeken,
is een geïntegreerd model van deze benadering voor de industriële zone Nhon Trach 2
IZ geanalyseerd. Dit model is gebaseerd op de gunstige  geografische ligging in elkaars
nabijheid van een cluster van zeven textielbedrijven in de betreffende industriële zone
en de beschikbaarheid van een extern netwerk voor afval-uitwisseling t.b.v.
afvalverwerking en afvalhergebruik. Het voorgestelde industrial ecology model kan een
waardevolle bijdrage leveren aan het tot stand komen van een duurzame economische
ontwikkeling. Het model is uitgewerkt aan de hand van een drietal stappen. De eerste
stap is te leren van de ervaring met het vergroeningsmodel dat ontwikkeld en
gedemonstreerd is voor Thanh Cong en dit model toe te passen voor alle
textielbedrijven in de betreffende industriële zone. De tweede stap is de oprichting van
een afvalnetwerk waarin een bedrijf, dat bijproducten kan gebruiken, een bedrijf dat
afval verwerkt en ook een extern netwerk dat zich bezig houdt met uitwisseling van
afval, vertegenwoordigd zijn. De laatste stap bestaat uit het behandelen van afval,
afgassen, afvalwater en hergebruik van het gezuiverde afvalwater als irrigatiewater (op
katoenplantages), voor sanitatiesystemen, voor productie als proceswater of drinkwater
of voor het schoonspoelen van wegen. Daarnaast moet ook een extern
afvalverwerkingcircuit en hergebruikcircuit worden opgezet voor afvalstromen zoals
plastic afval, papierafval, en afvalolie.
Het schoner produceren en de aanpak via het industrial ecology model kunnen bijdragen
aan een verbetering van de milieuprestaties van een industrie maar zijn alleen niet
voldoende om alle afval- en afvalwaterproblemen aan te kunnen pakken. De resultaten
van het literatuuroverzicht dat is gemaakt, tonen aan dat het afvalwater van de
textielindustrie, dat gekenmerkt wordt door hoge debieten aan afvalwater en hoge 291 concentraties aan vervuilende componenten, het meest vervuilende onderdeel is van de
textielindustrie. Met name gaat het daarbij om de aanwezigheid van kleurstoffen in het
afvalwater, die dan ook het grootste probleem vormt bij de behandeling van het
afvalwater. In het onderzoek is uitgebreid aandacht besteed aan het verwijderen van
kleurstoffen. Daarbij is onderzocht wat het effect is van de pH op de zichtbaarheid van
de in het afvalwater aanwezige kleurstoffen en hoe deze kleurstoffen kunnen worden
verwijderd door toepassing van coagulatie/flocculatieprocessen en geavanceerde
oxidatieprocessen (O3, O3/H2O2,  Fenton’s reagent). Het experimentele onderzoek is
daarbij uitgevoerd met diverse typen praktijkafvalwater (gedispergeerde en reactieve
kleustoffen, kuipkleurstoffen, gedispergeerde en zure kleurstoffen, zure kleurstoffen, en
gemengd
afvalwater
vervuild
met
verschillende
typen
kleurstoffen).
Deze
praktijkafvalwaterstromen waren afkomstig van een textielbedrijf in Vietnam, (28
Company-Agtex) en uit Belgie (UCO in Gent). Ook is onderzoek verricht met een
kunstmatig bereid afvalwater, bereid volgend een voorschrift van het textielbedrijf GVA
te Aalten in Nederland. Uit het experimentele onderzoek blijkt dat Fenton’s reagent de meest effectieve
methode is voor het behandelen van de vier genoemde typen afvalwater. Het
coagulatie/flocculatieproces is eveneens een zeer efficiënte methode voor het
verwijderen van de kleurstof uit de vier typen afvalwaterstromen, maar dit proces heeft
als nadeel dat het niet geschikt is voor afvalwater dat uitsluitend oplosbare kleurstoffen
bevat. Ontkleuring van het afvalwater met behulp van ozon bij lage pH (pH=5), waarbij
een directe oxidatie plaats vindt met moleculaire ozon, blijkt veel effectiever te zijn dan
oxidatie via hydroxyl radicalen. Het O3/H2O2 proces heeft de laagste efficiëntie in
vergelijking met ozon oxidatie en met Fenton’reagent. Het effect van verschillende
typen zuren (HCl and H2SO4) op de kleurintensiteit blijkt min of meer identiek te zijn.
Temperatuurvariaties in the range tussen 30 and 500C hebben slechts een gering effect
op het coagulatiepoces. Toepassing van geavanceerde oxidatiepocessen (AOPs) bij
hogere temperatuur (50 0C) resulteert in een daling in de kleurverwijderingsefficiëntie,
vergeleken met de verwijderingsefficiëntie die wordt verkregen bij 300C and 400C. De
fysisch/chemische processen zoals coagulatie/flocculatie, pH verandering en AOPs zijn,
indien toegepast als enkelvoudige individuele behandeling, slechts in beperkte mate
succesvol voor de behandeling van textielafvalwater. Elk van deze processen kan
slechts een of twee typen vervuiling elimineren uit het afvalwater met als consequentie
dat het effluent niet voldoet aan alle normen voor lozing. Om na te gaan op welke wijze
kan worden voldaan aan de lozingstandaards voor kleur en COD (50 Pt-Co en 50 mg
O2/L), zijn daarom ook combinaties van verschillende typen zuiveringsprocessen, in dit
geval coagulatie/ flocculatie, AOPs en biologische zuiveringsprocessen, onderzocht
voor de behandeling van gemengd textiel afvalwater. Het blijkt dat de combinatie van
een actief slibsysteem, coagulatie/flocculatie en ozon oxidatie het meest efficiënt is wat
betreft verwijdering van kleurstoffen en COD en tevens ook de laagste kosten heeft,
vergeleken met andere onderzochte zuiveringscombinaties. Bij de natte processen die in de textielindustrie worden toegepast, wordt 75% van de
totale waterconsumptie gebruikt voor het wasproces. De problemen bij de behandeling
van het afvalwater en de daarmee gepaard gaande kosten worden vooral veroorzaakt
door de behandeling van gemengd afvalwater dat gekenmerkt wordt door de
gelijktijdige aanwezigheid van verschillende typen kleurstoffen en andere vervuilende 292 componenten alsmede door de grote variatie in het type vervuilende componenten. Het
afvalwater van de meeste spoelprocessen bevat slechts lage concentraties aan
verontreinigingen en kan worden hergebruikt in andere processtappen of kan zonder
behandeling worden geloosd. Het doel van dit deel van het onderzoek was gericht op
het evalueren van de mogelijkheden om afvalwaterstromen in het bedrijf, in dit geval de
28 Company – Agtex, te scheiden. De totale afvalwaterstroom van dit bedrijf bedraagt
gemiddeld 700 m3/dag waarvan ca 130 m3 water per dag kan worden bespaard alsmede
10 m3 van een NaOH oplossing. Ongeveer 350 m3 van het afvalwater blijkt biologisch
goed afbreekbaar. Slechts 40 m3 van het afvalwater vertoont een hoge kleurintensiviteit
en heeft een hoge COD waarvoor een speciale afvalwaterbehandeling nodig is. Uit het
onderzoek blijkt dat scheiding van afvalwaterstromen kan resulteren in een besparing
van 122 US$/dag of 0.244 US$/m3. De resultaten tonen duidelijk aan dat scheiding van
afvalwaterstromen niet alleen hergebruik van het gezuiverde afvalwater mogelijk maakt
alsmede van teruggewonnen chemicaliën, maar ook de mogelijkheid biedt om de
efficiëntie van de verschillende zuiveringsprocessen te vergroten omdat elk
zuiveringsproces afzonderlijk kan worden geoptimaliseerd. Een analyse van het triad-netwerk van de beide casestudies, vergroening van de
productie van een individueel bedrijf en toepassing van het industrial ecology zone
model, laat zien dat een succesvolle industrial ecology praktijk niet alleen afhangt van
de interactie tussen de bedrijven binnen de industriële zone maar ook afhangt van de
interactie met de relevante actoren buiten het systeem. Het effect van het actoren
netwerk zal ook afhangen van de aard en de condities van elk van de individuele
bedrijven afzonderlijk. In het geval van Thanh Cong, een groot exportbedrijf, is het
economisch netwerk, wat in feite gevormd wordt door de consumenten, het belangrijkst.
Een sociaal/maatschappelijk netwerk kan ook invloed hebben op een commercieel
georiënteerd bedrijf via het gebruik van massamedia, waardoor veranderingen in het
milieubeleid van het bedrijf kunnen worden afgedwongen. Deze netwerken dragen dus
bij aan de implementatie van de modellen. Echter, in de huidige situatie in Vietnam is
de rol van het netwerk van de milieubeleidsbepalers nog beperkt, voornamelijk als
gevolg van de tekort komende wetgeving op nationaal en lokaal niveau. In het geval van
de casestudy betreffende de industrial ecology zone is het netwerk van de
beleidsbepalende instanties het belangrijkste bij de implementatie van het industriële
ecologische model. Met betrekking tot het economische netwerk zijn de buitenlandse
klanten en de Vietnam Textile & Apparel Association de belangrijke actoren die
bepalend zijn voor verbetering van de milieuprestaties. In de huidige situatie is de rol
van het sociaal/maatschappelijk netwerk beperkt als gevolg van de het feit dat de
staatsverantwoordelijkheid voor het milieu is gebaseerd op een top-down benadering en
het milieubesef van burgers zich nog vaak op een laag niveau bevindt. De vergroening
van de productie, de toepassing van industrial ecology, recycling and hergebruik van
afval tussen verschillende typen industrieen, en implementatie van end-of-pipe
technologie kan in feite alleen in praktijk worden gebracht wanneer de twee
hoofdaspecten, technologie en triad-netwerk, gelijktijdig en gecombineerd worden
ingezet. 293 TÓM TẮT Ngành công nghiệp Dệt may đã có những đóng góp đáng kể vào sự phát triển kinh tế
của Việt Nam (9% tổng giá trị công nghiệp) cũng như góp phần giải quyết việc làm cho
khoảng 2.5 triệu lao động trong cả nước. Ngành Dệt may Việt Nam được xếp vào trong
danh sách mười nước xuất khẩu hàng dệt may lớn nhất trên thế giới với việc mang lại
nguồn ngoại tệ hơn 9 tỷ US$ mỗi năm. Tuy nhiên Ngành Dệt may cũng được xếp vào
danh sách những ngành gây ô nhiễm môi trường nghiêm trọng với việc tiêu thụ một
lượng rất lớn nguyên, nhiêu liệu cũng như thải vào môi trường một thể tích lớn nước
thải với thành phần ô nhiễm cao và rất khó xử lý. Trong những năm gần đây Ngành Dệt
may đã chú trọng đến xử lý chất thải, đặc biệt là xử lý nước thải. Mặc dù số lượng các
nhà máy xây dựng trạm xử lý nước thải đã tăng lên nhưng hiện trạng ô nhiễm vẫn chưa
được cải thiện rõ rệt, nguyên nhân chủ yếu là do chi phí vận hành quá cao hoặc công
nghệ xử lý không thích hợp và nhận thức của doanh nghiệp về bảo vệ môi trường chưa
cao. Vì thế nước thải thường được thải ra môi trường mà không qua xử lý. Hậu quả của
chính sự xả thải này là môi trường tự nhiên bị phá hủy nghiêm trọng tại nhiều khu vực.
Khắc phục những nhược điểm của xử lý cuối đường ống một số giải pháp giảm thiểu ô
nhiễm khác cũng được áp dụng đối với Ngành Dệt may là Sản Xuất Sạch Hơn (CP) và
hệ thống quản lý môi trường theo tiêu chuẩn quốc tế ISO 14001. Tuy nhiên, cho đến
nay số lượng các doanh nghiệp áp dụng CP và ISO 14000 vẫn còn rất hạn chế. Việc
thực hiện công tác bảo vệ môi trường kém hiệu quả trong Ngành Dệt may liên quan đến
vai trò của các tổ chức như tổ chức chính quyền, kinh tế và xã hội.
Hiện nay, tại các nước công nghiệp hóa, nhiều giải pháp tiếp cận phòng ngừa ô nhiễm
đã được phát triển và ứng dụng như là sản xuất xanh, sinh thái công nghiệp và trao đổi
chất thải. Những giải pháp này được áp dụng để ngăn chặn sự phát sinh chất thải và
giảm thiểu ô nhiễm đến mức tối đa tại nguồn (sản xuất sạch hơn), tối ưu hóa những
dòng nguyên liệu và năng lượng đi vào trong hệ thống công nghiệp (công nghiệp sinh
thái) và trao đổi các sản phẩm phụ giữa các công ty trong và ngoài khu vực. Tuy nhiên,
không phải bất cứ giải pháp tiếp cận phòng ngừa ô nhiễm nào cũng có thể ứng dụng, tuỳ
thuộc vào điều kiện thực tế của mỗi nước các giải pháp tiếp cận phòng ngừa ô nhiễm sẽ
được thay đổi để việc thực hiện bảo vệ môi trường có hiệu quả hơn. Dựa vào những
điều kiện thực tế của Ngành Dệt may và chọn lọc những kinh nghiệm của các nước phát
triển, mô hình sản xuất xanh và mô hình khu sinh thái công nghiệp với việc kết hợp giải
pháp công nghệ xử lý cuối đường ống với mục đích tái sử dụng và tái chế chất thải đuợc
phát triển. Với việc ứng dụng các mô hình trên Ngành Dệt may có thể cải thiện sự ổn
định, tính bền vững và sản xuất hiệu quả hơn. Thuyết hiện đại hoá sinh nghiệp công
nghiệp được phát triển bởi Mol (1995) với áp dụng mô hình triad-network được sử dụng
trong nghiên cứu này nhằm mục đích phân tích vai trò của mỗi tổ chức trong thúc đẩy
ứng dụng của mô hình sản xuất xanh, công nghiệp sinh thái và xử lý cuối đường ống. Trong nghiên cứu này hai mô hình được phát triển: mô hình sản xuất xanh đối với một
công ty dệt may và mô hình khu công nghiệp sinh thái đối với khu công nghiệp. Kết quả
nghiên cứu đã chứng tỏ những lợi ích về kinh tế và môi trường của các giải pháp phòng
ngừa ô nhiễm. Mô hình sản xuất xanh được phát triển và đánh giá tại Công ty Thành
Công, một công ty dệt may có quy mô lớn tại thành phố Hồ Chí Minh. Mô hình này bao
gồm sự kết hợp của các giải pháp sản xuất sạch hơn và mạng lưới trao đổi chất thải bên
ngoài. Những lợi ích mang lại từ việc áp dụng mô hình sản xuất xanh là giảm đáng kể
lưu lượng và tải lượng chất ô nhiễm.  Hơn nữa, mạng lưới trao đổi chất thải bên ngoài 294 có thể giúp tái chế hầu hết các chất thải còn lại bằng việc tái sử dụng chúng như là
nguồn nguyên liệu sản xuất cho các công ty khác. Mô hình sản xuất xanh đã đưa ra một
cách tiếp cận mới mang tính khả thi và hấp dẫn đối với sự phát triển bền vững của một
công ty dệt may có qui mô lớn.
Nghiên cứu mối liên quan của tiếp cận hệ sinh thái công nghiệp trong trường hợp của Việt Nam, một mô hình tổng hợp khu công nghiệp sinh thái dệt may tại KCN Nhơn
Trạch 2 được phát triển. Mô hình này dựa trên mối quan hệ cùng có lợi của bảy doanh
nghiệp dệt may có vị trí địa lý gần nhau trong khu công nghiệp Nhơn Trạch 2 và mạng
lưới trao đổi chất thải bên ngoài. Mô hình khu công nghiệp sinh thái dệt may mang lại
những đóng góp có giá trị để đạt được sự phát triển bền vững.
Mô hình khu công nghiệp sinh thái dệt may được phát triển trong ba bước. Bước đầu
tiên những bài học kinh nghiệm từ mô hình của Công ty Thành Công được áp dụng cho
bảy công ty dệt may trong khu công nghiệp Nhơn Trạch 2. Bước thứ hai là hình thành
một mạng lưới trao đổi chất thải, trong mạng lưới này bao gồm một doanh nghiệp tái
chế sản phẩm phụ, một doanh nghiệp xử lý chất thải, và những doanh nghiệp tái chế
chất thải bên ngoài. Bước cuối cùng là xử lý chất thải rắn, khí thải và xử lý và tái sử
dụng nước thải (sử dụng các kết quả từ chương 3, 4 và 5) cho tưới tiêu (các khu vực
trồng bông), sử dụng cho các thiết bị vệ sinh, tưới cây và tưới đường trong khu công
nghiệp. Ngoài ra, một vài hoạt động trao đổi chất thải bên ngoài khu công nghiệp cũng
phải được thiết lập đối với  tái chế nhựa, giấy và dầu thải phát sinh từ khu công nghiệp. Những giải pháp tiếp cận sản xuất sạch hơn và khu công nghiệp sinh thái có thể giúp cải
thiện thực hiện bảo vệ môi trường trong Ngành Dệt may, nhưng việc áp dụng những
giải pháp này lại không thể xử lý tất cả các dòng chất thải, đặc biệt là nước thải. Các kết
quả từ khảo sát thực tế và tổng quan tài liệu đã chỉ ra rằng đặc tính của nước thải dệt
nhuộm có nồng độ ô nhiễm cao (đặc biệt là độ màu) và với lưu lượng lớn, vì thế nước
thải được xem là nguồn ô nhiễm lớn nhất của ngành dệt may.
Độ màu được xem như là một trong những thông số quan trọng đối với xử lý nước thải
dệt nhuộm. Việc loại bỏ độ màu của nước thải dệt nhuộm đã được nghiên cứu với thay
đổi độ pH, áp dụng quá trình keo tụ/tạo bông và các quá trình oxy hóa bậc cao (O3,
O3/H2O2 và hệ tác nhân Fenton). Thí nghiệm được thực hiện với nhiều dòng nước thải
khác nhau (dòng nước thải có chứa thuốc nhuộm phân tán và hoạt tính, thuốc nhuộm
hoàn nguyên, thuốc nhuộm phân tán và acid, hỗn hợp của nhiều dòng nước thải, và
nước thải có chứa thuốc nhuộm acid). Nước thải được lấy tại một công ty dệt may trong
Việt Nam (28 Công ty-Agtex), tại Bỉ (nhà máy dệt UCO, Gent) và nước thải tổng hợp
được chuẩn bị theo công thức của Công ty Dệt may GVA ở Aalten, Hà Lan. Hệ tác
nhân Fenton là phương pháp hiệu quả nhất để loại bỏ độ màu của bốn dòng nước thải.
Qúa trình keo tụ/tạo bông cũng là một phương pháp rất hiệu quả đối với loại bỏ độ màu
của bốn dòng nước thải trên, nhưng qúa trình này lại không phù hợp với loại nước thải
chỉ chứa thuốc nhuộm hòa tan. Đối với khử độ màu của nước thải bằng quá trình ozone
ở giá trị pH thấp (pH 5), kết quả cho thấy oxy hóa trực tiếp bởi các phân tử ozon có tính
chọn lọc hơn rất nhiều so với quá trình oxy hóa của các gốc hydroxyl. Quá trình oxy
hóa Peroxon (O3/H2O2) cho hiệu quả loại bỏ độ màu thấp nhất so với quá trình oxy hóa
với ozone và hệ tác nhân Fenton. Thay đổi pH không làm giảm độ màu. Ảnh hưởng của
các loại acid khác nhau (HCl và H2SO4) trong thí nghiệm thay đổi pH hầu như không
đáng kể. Nhiệt độ trong khoảng từ 30 đến 50oC ít ảnh hưởng đến quá trình keo tụ. Đối
với các quá trình oxy hóa bậc cao (AOPs) tại điều kiện nhiệt độ cao (50oC) hiệu quả xử
lý giảm so với ở nhiệt độ 30oC và 40oC. 295 Đối với xử lý nước thải dệt nhuộm những quá trình hoá lý/hoá học như thay đổi pH, keo
tụ và oxy hóa bậc cao (AOPs) chỉ đạt được hiệu quả nhất định khi được áp dụng như
các quá trình xử lý riêng lẻ. Mỗi quá trình xử lý trên chỉ có thể loại bỏ được một hay vài
chất ô nhiễm trong nước thải do đó nước thải sau xử lý thường không đạt được tất cả
những chỉ tiêu trong qui định xả thải. Vì thế kết hợp của các qúa trình xử lý được
nghiên cứu để xử lý nước thải đạt được những quy định xả thải nghiêm ngặt như độ
màu và COD (50 Pt-Co và 50 mgO2/L). Kết hợp giữa các quá trình keo tụ, oxy hóa bậc
cao và sinh học (và ngược lại) được thực hiện đối với dòng nước thải hỗn hợp. Trong
đó, sự kết hợp của quá trình bùn hoạt tính, keo tụ và ozon đưa ra kết quả khử độ màu và
COD tốt nhất với chi phí thấp nhất so với tất cả các nghiên cứu khác. Công nghệ nhuộm theo phương pháp ướt đang được áp dụng rộng rãi trong Ngành Dệt
may, 75% lượng nước tiêu thụ được sử dụng trong quá trình giặt/xả. Khó khăn trong xử
lý nước thải dệt nhuộm và chi phí xử lý sẽ tăng lên là do trộn lẫn của nhiều dòng nước
thải phát sinh từ nhiều công đoạn khác nhau trong quá trình nhuộm với sự thay đổi rất
lớn về nồng độ và loại hoá chất và thuốc nhuộm sử dụng. Ngoài ra, hầu hết các bước xả
có chứa các chất ô nhiễm ở nồng độ thấp và có thể được tái sử dụng lại trong các công
đọan sản xuất khác hoặc có thể được xả thải trực tiếp mà không qua xử lý. Tách dòng
chất thải được nghiên cứu tại Công ty 28 - Agtex. Tổng lưu lượng nước thải của công ty
28 - Agtex là 700 m3/ngày, trong đó 130 m3 nước và 10 m3 dung dịch NaOH có thể
được thu hồi. Khoảng 350 m3 nước thải có khả năng phân hủy sinh học. Chỉ có khoảng
40 m3 nước thải có độ màu và COD cao cần xử lý đặc biệt. Việc tách các dòng chất thải
có thể tiết kiệm 122 USD/ngày hay 0,244 USD/m3. Kết quả cho thấy sự tách dòng nước
thải không chỉ cho phép tái sử dụng nước và hóa chất, mà còn làm tăng hiệu quả xử lý
vì mỗi dòng nước thải riêng biệt có thể được xử lý theo từng phương pháp tối ưu. Mô hình triad-network được áp dụng nhằm phân tích vai trò của các tổ chức và mối
tương quan giũa chúng với hệ công nghiệp. Nghiên cứu điển hình đối với mô hình sản
xuất xanh và khu công nghiệp sinh thái cho thấy sự thành công của khu công nghiệp
sinh thái trong thực tế không chỉ phụ thuộc vào sự tương tác giữa các doanh nghiệp
trong khu công nghiệp mà còn phụ thuộc vào sự tương tác với các đối tượng bên ngoài
hệ thống. Ảnh hưởng của mô hình trial-network phụ thuộc vào đặc tính và điều kiện của
mỗi doanh nghiệp hay ngành công nghiệp. Trong trường hợp của Công ty Thành Công,
một công ty xuất khẩu hàng dệt may với qui mô lớn, hệ thống kinh tế ảnh hưởng rất lớn
đối với cải thiện thực hiện bảo vệ môi trường trong doanh nghiệp: ví dụ vai trò của
khách hàng. Hệ thống xã hội ảnh hưởng đến một công ty thương mại thông qua việc sử
dụng các phương tiện truyền thông đại chúng và thông qua áp lực của xã hội thay đổi
hành vi của người gây ô nhiễm. Những hệ thống này góp phần vào việc thực hiện mô
hình. Tuy nhiên, vai trò của hệ thống chính sách còn hạn chế trong điều kiện của Việt
Nam. Trong trường hợp khu công nghiệp sinh thái, hệ thống chính sách đóng vai trò
quan trọng nhất trong việc thực hiện các mô hình sinh thái công nghiệp. Liên quan đến
hệ thống kinh tế, vai trò của các khách hàng nước ngoài và Hiệp hội dệt may Việt Nam
là những đối tượng quan trọng trong việc cải thiện thực hiện bảo vệ môi trường. Trong
khi đó vai trò của các đối tượng trong hệ thống xã hội thì vẫn còn rất hạn chế trong thời
điểm hiện tại, bên cạnh đó ý thức bảo vệ môi trường của người dân còn thấp. Mô hình sản xuất xanh, sinh thái công nghiệp, trao đổi chất thải và mô hình xử lý cuối
đường ống chỉ có thể ứng dụng thành công trong thực tế khi có sự kết hợp của hai khía
cạnh: công nghệ và quản lý . 296 297 REFERENCES
