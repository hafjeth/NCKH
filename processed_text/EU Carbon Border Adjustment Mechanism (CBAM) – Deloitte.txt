Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)
The EU ETS | Reducing industrial emissions
•
The EU Emissions Trading System is the
core EU mechanism that ensures industrial
decarbonisation in line with the Green Deal. It
aims to achieve this by reducing the permitted cap
on GHG emissions of the target sectors over time,
and reducing the allotted free emission
allowances.
•
The Green Deal provides a roadmap and sets goals
to reach climate neutrality by 2050.
•
To mitigate this risk, sectors and sub-sectors
considered to be at risk of carbon leakage
currently receive some or all of their ETS emission
allowances for free (‘free allowances’).
•
As the allotment of free allowances is set to
reduce, the EU is proposing the CBAM to
mitigate carbon leakage for specific ETS sectors
considered to be at high risk and create a level
playing field between EU manufacturers and
importers.
•
The increased costs associated with the CBAM
will incentivise companies to invest in more
sustainable supply chains.
Fit for 55 package
•
The Green Deal includes the Climate Law and Fit
for 55 package which binds the EU and Member
states to a goal of achieving climate neutrality by
2050.
•
The package also defines an interim EU target of
reducing GHG emissions by at least 55% by 2030
compared with 1990 levels.

Background
The Green Deal
•
The EU has adopted a sustainable growth plan to
support its Green Transition.
The EU CBAM | Mitigating carbon leakage
•
Carbon leakage refers to the situation where
businesses transfer their production from
countries with strict(er) emission policies to
countries with lax(er) emissions regulations, which
leads to an overall increase in total emissions. The
risk of carbon leakage is higher in certain energy
intensive industries.

Rules have been prescribed to determine –
• CBAM classification categorization
• Direct emissions
• Indirect emissions
• Monitoring methods
Penalties may also be levied based on
non-reporting/ wrong reporting during
transitional period – EUR 10 to 50 per ton
of unreported embedded emissions.
During the definitive period, these
penalties are expected to be linked to the
EU ETS Carbon Price
CBAM will not be applicable to imports of –
• Goods originating from countries
covered by the EU ETS (i.e. EEA
countries);
• Goods originating from countries with a
domestic ETS linked with EU ETS (i.e.
Switzerland);
• Low value shipments (subject to change
pending
legislative
approvals),
and
goods to be moved or used for military
purposes.

Scope Emissions
What is
CBAM’s Scope?
CBAM covers the following embedded emissions:
• Direct emissions arising from the production processes
of CBAM goods, including emissions from the
production of heating and cooling, consumed during
production processes.
• Indirect emissions – for specific CBAM goods - arising
from the production of electricity consumed during
the production processes.
Good to
Know!

As a part of the EU’s Omnibus package,
amendments were proposed to the CBAM
legislation on February 26, 2025, which is
undergoing EU legislative review. This
includes certain simplifications to reduce
compliance burden, improve alignment
with global standards, and enhance
European competitiveness. 4

Financial Impact
of CBAM
EU aluminum imports as of 2026
Importers will need to surrender a gradually increasing
number of CBAM certificates between 2026 and 2034
to cover imported embedded GHG emissions. This
phase-in aligns with the phase-out of free allowances
within the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS).
For imports of aluminium, this will entail the following
(indicative) additional cost:
