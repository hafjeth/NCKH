COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2023/1773
of 17 August 2023
laying down the rules for the application of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European Parliament
and of the Council as regards reporting obligations for the purposes of the carbon border
adjustment mechanism during the transitional period
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 May 2023 establishing a
carbon border adjustment mechanism (1), and in particular Article 35(7) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
Regulation (EU) 2023/956 lays down reporting obligations for the purposes of carbon border adjustment
mechanism during the transitional period from 1 October 2023 until 31 December 2025.
(2)
During the transitional period, importers or indirect customs representatives are to report on the quantity of
imported goods, direct and indirect emissions embedded in them, and any carbon price due for those emissions,
including carbon prices due for emissions embedded in relevant precursor materials.
(3)
The first report should be submitted by 31 January 2024 in respect of goods imported during the fourth quarter of
2023. The last report should be submitted by 31 January 2026 in respect of goods imported during the fourth
quarter of 2025.
(4)
The Commission is to adopt implementing rules for those reporting requirements.
(5)
The reporting requirements should be limited to what is necessary to minimise the burden on importers in the
transitional period and facilitate the smooth roll-out of the CBAM declaration requirements after the transitional
period.
(6)
In line with Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 2023/956, the detailed rules for calculating embedded emissions of
imported goods should be based on the methodology applicable under the Emission Trading Scheme for
installations located in the EU, as notably specified in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 (2).
The principles for determining the embedded emissions of the goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2023/956
should aim at identifying the relevant production processes for goods categories, and to monitor the direct and
indirect emissions of those production processes. Reporting during the transitional period should also take into
account existing norms and procedures of relevant Union legislation. As regards the production of hydrogen and its
derivatives, the reporting should take into account Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the
Council (3).
(7)
The system boundaries of production processes, including emissions data at installation level, attributed emissions of
production processes and embedded emissions of goods should be used for determining data to be provided for the
purpose of fulfilling the reporting obligations. For those obligations, the importers and indirect customs
representatives should ensure the availability of information needed from the operators of installations. That
information should be received in a timely manner for the importers and indirect customs representatives to fulfil
their reporting obligations. That information should include standard emission factors to use for calculating direct
embedded emissions, notably fuel emission factors and process emission factors and reference efficiency factors for
electricity and heat production.

(2) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 of 19 December 2018 on the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas
emissions pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Commission Regulation
(EU) No 601/2012 (OJ L 334, 31.12.2018, p. 1).
(3) Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy
from renewable sources (OJ L 328, 21.12.2018, p. 82).

15.9.2023 (8)
Since the beginning of the reporting period starts on 1 October 2023, importers and indirect customs
representatives have limited time available to ensure compliance with the reporting obligations. Synergies can be
obtained with the monitoring and reporting systems already used by third country operators. A temporary
derogation to the calculation methods for reporting embedded emissions should therefore be allowed for a limited
period, until end of 2024. That flexibility should apply when the operator in a third country is subject to a
mandatory monitoring and reporting system associated to a carbon pricing scheme, or to other mandatory
monitoring and reporting schemes, or when the operator is monitoring the emissions of the installation, including
for an emissions reduction project.
(9)
For a limited period, until 31 July 2024, reporting declarants that would not be able to obtain all the information
from third country operators to determine the actual embedded emissions of the imported goods in accordance
with the methodology set in Annex III to this Regulation should be able to use and refer to an alternative method
for determining the direct embedded emissions.
(10)
The reporting obligations should also afford some flexibility for the determination of the production steps in
installations that do not account for a significant part of the embedded direct emissions of the imported goods.
Such would be typically the case for the final production steps of steel or aluminium downstream products. In that
case, a derogation from the required reporting obligations should be provided and estimated values may be
reported for the production steps in installations whose contribution to direct emissions do not exceed 20 % of the
total embedded emissions of the imported goods. That threshold should ensure sufficient flexibility for small
operators in third countries.
(11)
One of the objectives of the transitional period is to collect data for the purpose of further specifying, in the
implementing act pursuant to Article 7(7) of Regulation (EU) 2023/956, the methodology for calculating embedded
indirect emissions after that period. In that context, the reporting of indirect emissions during the transitional period
should be open and designed to allow to select the most appropriate value among those listed in Section 4.3 in
Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 2023/956. Reporting of indirect emissions should however not include reporting
based on the average emission factor of the Union grid as that value is already known by the Commission.
(12)
Data collected during the transitional period should provide the basis for the reports that the Commission is to
present in accordance with Article 30(2) and (3) of Regulation (EU) 2023/956. Data collected during the
transitional period should also help define a unique monitoring, reporting and verification methodology after the
transitional period. The assessment of data collected should in particular be used for the Commission’s work in
view of adjusting the methodology applicable after the transitional period.
(13)
The indicative range of penalties that are to be imposed on a reporting declarant who has failed to respect the
reporting obligations should be based on the default values made available and published by the Commission for
the transitional period for the embedded emissions that were not reported. The indicative maximum range should
be coherent with the penalty pursuant to Article 16(3) and (4) of Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament
and of the Council (4), while also taking into account that the obligation in the transitional period is limited to data
reporting. The criteria to be used by competent authorities for determining the actual amount of the penalty should
be based on the gravity and duration of the failure to report. The Commission should monitor the CBAM reports in
order to provide for an indicative assessment of the information needed by the competent authorities and to ensure
coherency of the penalties to be applied.
(14)
In order to ensure the efficient implementation of reporting obligations, an electronic database, the CBAM
Transitional Registry, should be established by the Commission to collect the information reported during the
transitional period. The CBAM Transitional Registry should be the basis for the establishment of the CBAM Registry
pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 2023/956.
(4) Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas
emission allowance trading within the Union and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (OJ L 275, 25.10.2003, p. 32).
EN
Official Journal of the European Union
15.9.2023
L 228/95 (15)
The CBAM Transitional Registry should become the system for the filing and management of the CBAM reports for
reporting declarants, including checks, indicative assessments, and review procedures. To ensure an accurate
assessment of the reporting obligations, the CBAM Transitional Registry should be interoperable with existing
customs systems.
(16)
In order to ensure an effective and uniform reporting system, technical arrangements for the functioning of the
CBAM Transitional Registry should be laid down, such as arrangements for the development, testing and
deployment as well as for the maintenance and potential modifications of the electronic systems, data protection,
updating of data, limitation of data processing, systems ownership, and security. These arrangements should be
compatible with the principle of data protection by design and by default under Article 27 of Regulation
(EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) and Article 25 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of
the European Parliament and of the Council (6), as well as with security of processing under Article 33 of Regulation
(EU) 2018/1725 and Article 32 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
(17)
In order to ensure the continuity of data reporting at all times, it is important to provide for alternative solutions to
be implemented in the event of a temporary failure of the electronic systems for data reporting. To that effect, the
Commission should work on a CBAM business continuity plan.
(18)
In order to secure access to the CBAM Transitional Registry, the Uniform User Management and Digital Signature
(UUM&DS) system, as referred to in Article 16 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1070 (7),
should be used for managing, the authentication, and access verification process for reporting declarants.
(19)
For the purpose of identifying the reporting declarants and establishing a list of the reporting declarants with their
Economic Operator Registration and Identification (EORI) numbers, the CBAM Transitional Registry should be
interoperable with the Economic Operator Registration and Identification system, as referred to in Article 30 of
Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1070.
(20)
For checking and reporting purposes, the national systems should provide the required information on goods listed
in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2023/956, as referred in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/2151 (8).
(21)
Identifying imported goods by means of their classification in the Combined Nomenclature (‘CN’) set out in Council
Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 (9) and the storage provisions set out in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1070
should be used for providing information on imported goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2023/956.
(22)
This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the Charter of
Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and notably the right to protection of personal data. The personal data
of economic operators and other persons processed by the electronic systems should be restricted to the dataset set
out in Annex I to this Regulation. Where it is necessary, for the purposes of the Implementing Regulation, to
process personal data, this should be carried out in accordance with Union law on the protection of personal data.
(5) Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of individuals with
regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such
data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (EU Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 295,
21.11.2018, p. 39).
(6) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with
regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data
Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1).
(7) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1070 of 1 June 2023 on technical arrangements for developing, maintaining and
employing electronic systems for the exchange and storage of information under Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European
Parliament and the Council (OJ L 143, 2.6.2023, p. 65).
(8) Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/2151 of 13 December 2019 establishing the work programme relating to the
development and deployment of the electronic systems provided for in the Union Customs Code (OJ L 325, 16.12.2019, p. 168).

L 228/96
15.9.2023 In that regard, any processing of personal data by Member States’ authorities should be subject to Regulation
(EU) 2016/679 and national requirements on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of
personal data. Any processing of personal data by the Commission should be subject to Regulation
(EU) 2018/1725. Personal data should be kept in a form which permits the identification of data subjects for no
longer than necessary for the purposes for which personal data are processed. In this regard, the data retention
period for the CBAM Transitional Registry shall be limited to 5 years from the reception of the CBAM report.

‘activity level’ means the quantity of goods produced (expressed in MWh for electricity, or in tonnes for other goods)
within the boundaries of a production process;
(2)
‘reporting period’ means a period that the operator of an installation has chosen to use as reference for the
determination of embedded emissions;
(3)
‘source stream’ means any of the following:
(a) a specific fuel type, raw material or product giving rise to emissions of relevant greenhouse gases at one or more
emission sources as a result of its consumption or production;
(b) a specific fuel type, raw material or product containing carbon and included in the calculation of greenhouse gas
emissions using a mass balance method;
(4)
‘emission source’ means a separately identifiable part of an installation or a process within an installation, from which
relevant greenhouse gases are emitted;
(5)
‘uncertainty’ means a parameter, associated with the result of the determination of a quantity, that characterises the
dispersion of the values that could reasonably be attributed to the particular quantity, including the effects of
systematic as well as of random factors, expressed in per cent, and describes a confidence interval around the mean
value comprising 95 % of inferred values taking into account any asymmetry of the distribution of values;
(6)
‘calculation factors’ means net calorific value, emission factor, preliminary emission factor, oxidation factor,
conversion factor, carbon content or biomass fraction;
(7)
‘combustion emissions’ means greenhouse gas emissions occurring during the exothermic reaction of a fuel with
oxygen;
(8)
‘emission factor’ means the average emission rate of a greenhouse gas relative to the activity data of a source stream
assuming complete oxidation for combustion and complete conversion for all other chemical reactions;
(9)
‘oxidation factor’ means the ratio of carbon oxidised to CO2 as a consequence ofcombustion to the total carbon
contained in the fuel, expressed as a fraction, considering carbon monoxide (CO) emitted to the atmosphere as the
molar equivalent amount of CO2;
(10) ‘conversion factor’ means the ratio of carbon emitted as CO2 to the total carbon contained in the source stream before
the emitting process takes place, expressed as a fraction, considering CO emitted to the atmosphere as the molar
equivalent amount of CO2;
(11) ‘accuracy’ means the closeness of the agreement between the result of a measurement and the true value of the
particular quantity or a reference value determined empirically using internationally accepted and traceable
calibration materials and standard methods, taking into account both random and systematic factors;
(12) ‘calibration’ means the set of operations, which establishes, under specified conditions, the relations between values
indicated by a measuring instrument or measuring system, or values represented by a material measure or a
reference material and the corresponding values of a quantity realised by a reference standard;
(13) ‘conservative’ means that a set of assumptions is defined in order to ensure that no under-estimation of reported
emissions or over-estimation of production of heat, electricity or goods occurs;

public order, protection of the environment, the levying of taxes and duties, the protection of consumers and fair
trading;
(19) ‘data flow activities’ mean activities related to the acquisition, processing and handling of data that are needed to draft
an emissions report from primary source data;
(20) ‘measurement system’ means a complete set of measuring instruments and other equipment, such as sampling and
data processing equipment, used to determine variables such as the activity data, the carbon content, the calorific

However, where ammonia produced without direct fossil CO2 emissions is used as a precursor, the used CO2 may be
deducted from the direct emissions of the installation producing the CO2, provided that the delegated act adopted pursuant
to Article 12(3b) of Directive 2003/87/EC defines urea production as a case where CO2 is permanently chemically bound
so that it does not enter the atmosphere under normal use, including any normal activity taking place after the end of the

L 228/141 ANNEX III
Rules for determining data including on emissions at installation level, attributed emissions of
production processes, and embedded emissions of goods
A.
PRINCIPLES
A.1.
Overall approach
1.
For the purpose of determining embedded emissions of goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2023/956, the
following activities shall be performed:
(a) The production processes relating to goods produced in the installation shall be identified using the
aggregated goods categories as defined in Section 2 of Annex II, as well as the relevant production routes
listed in Section 3 of Annex II, taking into account the rules for setting system boundaries of production
processes in accordance with Section A.4 of this Annex.
(b) At the level of the installation producing the goods, the direct emissions of the greenhouse gases specified in
Annex II for those goods shall be monitored in line with the methods provided in Section B of this Annex.
(c) Where measurable heat is imported to, produced in, consumed in or exported from the installation, net heat
flows and the emissions associated with the production of that heat shall be monitored in line with the
methods provided in Section C of this Annex.
(d) For the purpose of monitoring indirect emissions embedded in the goods produced, the consumption of
electricity in the relevant production processes shall be monitored in line with the methods provided in
Section D.1 of this Annex. Where electricity is produced within the installation or by a source with a direct
technical link, the emissions associated with that electricity production shall be monitored in order to
determine the emission factor for that electricity. Where the installation receives electricity from the grid, the
emission factor for that electricity shall be determined according to Section D.2.3 of this Annex. Any
quantities of electricity transferred between production processes or exported from the installation shall be
monitored as well.
(e) The direct emissions at the installations, with heat production and consumption, electricity production and
consumption, and any relevant waste gas streams shall be attributed to the production processes associated
with the goods produced by applying the rules provided in Section F of this Annex. Those attributed
emissions shall be used to calculate the specific direct and indirect embedded emissions of the goods
produced, applying the Section F of this Annex.
(f)
Where Section 3 of Annex II defines relevant precursors for goods produced in the installations, making those
goods ‘complex goods’, the embedded emissions of the relevant precursor shall be determined according to
Section E of this Annex, and shall be added to the embedded emissions of the complex goods produced, by
applying the rules provided in Section G of this Annex. Where precursors are themselves complex goods,
that process shall be repeated recursively until no more precursors are at stake.
2.
Where an operator cannot adequately determine actual data for one or more data sets, by applying methods
provided in Section A.3 of this Annex, and where no other method for closing data gaps is available, the default
values made available and published by the Commission for the transitional period may be used under the
conditions specified in Article 4(3) of this Regulation. In that case, a short explanation of the reasons for not
using actual data shall be added.
3.
Monitoring shall cover a reporting period which ensures that non-representative data due to short-time
fluctuations in the production processes and data gaps are avoided to the highest extent feasible. The default
reporting period is a calendar year. However, the operator may choose as alternative:
(a) if the installation has a compliance obligation under an eligible monitoring, reporting and verification system,
that system’s reporting period may be used, if it covers at least three months;
EN
Official Journal of the European Union
L 228/142
15.9.2023 (b) the operator’s fiscal year provided such period ensures higher data quality than the use of the calendar year.
The embedded emissions of goods shall be calculated as average of the reporting period chosen.
4.
Regarding emissions occurring outside the installation boundaries that are relevant for calculating embedded
emissions, data for the latest available reporting period shall be used, as obtained from the supplier of the input
(e.g. electricity, heat, precursor). Emissions occurring outside the installation boundaries include:
(a) indirect emissions where electricity is received from the grid;
(b) emissions from electricity and heat imported from other installations;
(c) embedded direct and indirect emissions of precursors received from other installations.
5.
Emissions data over a full reporting period shall be expressed in tonnes CO2e rounded to full tonnes.
All parameters used to calculate the emissions shall be rounded to include all significant digits for the purpose of
calculating and reporting emissions.
Specific direct and indirect embedded emissions shall be expressed in tonnes of CO2e per tonne of goods, rounded
to include all significant digits, with a maximum of 5 digits after the comma.
A.2.
Monitoring principles
For the monitoring of actual data at installation level, and for data sets necessary for attributing emissions to goods, the
following principles shall apply:
1. Completeness: The monitoring methodology shall cover all parameters necessary to determine the embedded emissions
of the goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2023/956 in accordance with the methods and formulae contained in
this Annex.
(a) Direct emissions at installation level include combustion and process emissions.
(b) Direct embedded emissions include the attributed emissions of the relevant production process in accordance with
Section F of this Annex, based on direct emissions at the installation, emissions related to relevant heat flows and to
material flows between process system boundaries, including waste gases, if relevant. Direct embedded emissions
furthermore include the direct embedded emissions of relevant precursors.
(c) Indirect emissions at the installation level cover the emissions related to electricity consumption within the
installation.
(d) Indirect embedded emissions include the indirect emissions of the goods produced within the installation, and the
indirect embedded emissions of relevant precursors.
(e) For each parameter, an appropriate method in accordance with Section A.3 of this Annex shall be selected, ensuring
that neither double counting nor data gaps occur.
2. Consistency and comparability: Monitoring and reporting shall be consistent and comparable over time. To that end,
the selected methods shall be laid down in a written monitoring methodology documentation so that the methods are
used consistently. The methodology shall be changed only if objectively justified. Relevant reasons include:
(a) changes in the configuration of the instalation in the technology used, in the input materials and fuels, or in the
goods produced;
(b) new data sources or monitoring methods have to be introduced because of changes of trade partners responsible for
data used in the monitoring methodology;
(c) the accuracy of the data can be improved, data flows can be simplified or the control system can be improved.
EN
Official Journal of the European Union
15.9.2023
L 228/143 3. Transparency: Monitoring data shall be obtained, recorded, compiled, analysed and documented, including
assumptions, references, activity data, emission factors, calculation factors, data on embedded emissions of purchased
precursors, measurable heat and electricity, default values of embedded emissions, information on a carbon price due,
and any other data relevant for the purpose of this Annex, in a transparent manner that enables the reproduction of
the determination of emissions data including by independent third parties, such as accredited verifiers.
Documentation shall include a record of all changes of methodology.
Complete and transparent records shall be kept at the installation of all data relevant for determining embedded
emissions of the goods produced, including necessary supporting documents, for at least 4 years after the reporting
period. Those records may be disclosed to a reporting declarant.
4. Accuracy: The chosen monitoring methodology shall ensure that emission determination is neither systematically nor
knowingly inaccurate. Any source of inaccuracies shall be identififed and reduced as far as possible. Due diligence shall
be exercised to ensure that the calculation and measurement of emissions exhibit the highest achievable accuracy.
Where data gaps have occurred or are expected to be unavoidable, substitute data shall consist of conservative estimates.
Further cases where emissions data shall be based on conservative estimates include:
(a) carbon monoxide (CO) emitted to the atmosphere shall be calculated as the molar equivalent amount of CO2;
(b) all biomass emissions in mass balances and for transferred CO2, where it is not possible to determine the biomass
content in materials or fuels, the emissions shall be considered to be from fossil carbon.
5. Integrity of methodology: The chosen monitoring methodology shall enable reasonable assurance of the integrity of
emission data to be reported. Emissions shall be determined using the appropriate monitoring methodologies set out in
this Annex. Reported emission data shall be free from material misstatement, avoid bias in the selection and
presentation of information, and provide a credible and balanced account of the embedded emissions of installation’s
produced goods.
6. Optional measures to increase the quality of the data to be reported may be applied, in particular the data flow and
control activities in line with Section H of this Annex.
7. Cost-effectiveness: In selecting a monitoring methodology, the improvements from greater accuracy shall be balanced
against additional costs. Monitoring and reporting of emissions shall aim for the highest achievable accuracy, unless
that is technically not feasible or incurs unreasonable costs.
8. Continuous improvement: It shall be regularly checked if monitoring methodologies can be improved. If verification of
emissions data is performed, any recommendations for improvements included in the verification reports shall be
considered for implementation within a reasonable timeframe, unless the improvement would incur unreasonable
costs or would be technically not feasible.
A.3.
Methods representing the best available data source
1.
For the determination of embedded emissions of goods, and for underlying data sets, such as emissions related to
individual source streams or emission sources, quantities of measurable heat, the overarching principle shall be to
always select the best available data source. For this purpose, the following guiding principles shall apply:
(a) Monitoring methods described in this Annex are preferred. If for a specific data set there is no monitoring method
described in this Annex, or it would incur unreasonable costs or is technically not feasible, monitoring methods
from another eligible monitoring, reporting and verification system may be used under the conditions specified in
Article 4(2) of this Regulation, if they cover the required data set. Where such methods are not available, not
technically feasible, or would incur unreasonable costs, indirect methods for determination of the data set in
EN
Official Journal of the European Union
L 228/144
15.9.2023 accordance with point 2 may be used. Where such methods are not available, not technically feasible, or would
incur unreasonable costs, default values made available and published by the Commission for the transitional
period may be used under the conditions specified in Article 4(3) of this Regulation.
(b) For direct or indirect determination methods, a method is deemed suitable where it is ensured that any metering,
analyses, sampling, calibrations, and validations for the determination of the specific data set are carried out by
applying methods defined in relevant EN or ISO standards. Where such standards are not available, national
standards may be used. Where no applicable published standards exist, suitable draft standards, industry best
practice guidelines or other scientifically proven methodologies shall be used, limiting sampling and measurement
bias.
(c) Within one method mentioned in point (a), measuring instruments or laboratory analyses under the operator’s
control shall be preferred over measuring instruments or analyses under the control of another legal entity, such
as the supplier of fuel or materials or trade partners regarding goods produced.
(d) Measuring instruments shall be selected such that they exhibit the lowest uncertainty in use without incurring
unreasonable costs. Instruments under legal metrological control are preferred, except where other instruments
with significantly lower uncertainty in use are available. Instruments shall be used only in environments
appropriate according to their use specification.
(e) Where laboratory analyses are used, or where laboratories carry out sample treatment, calibrations, method
validations, or activities relating to continuous emissions measurements, the requirements of Section B.5.4.3 of
this Annex shall apply.
2.
Indirect determination methods: Where no direct determination method is available for a required data set, in
particular for cases where net measurable heat going into different production processes needs to be determined, an
indirect determination method may be used, such as:
(a) calculation based on a known chemical or physical process, using appropriate accepted literature values for the
chemical and physical properties of substances involved, appropriate stoichiometric factors and thermodynamic
properties such as reaction enthalpies, as appropriate;
(b) calculation based on the installation’s design data such as the energy efficiencies of technical units or calculated
energy consumption per unit of product;
(c) correlations based on empirical tests for determining estimation values for the required data set from non-
calibrated equipment or data documented in production protocols. For that purpose it shall be ensured that the
correlation satisfies the requirements of good engineering practice and that it is applied only to determine values
which fall into the range for which it was established. The validity of such correlations shall be evaluated at least
once a year.
3.
To determine the best available data sources, the data source highest in the ranking presented under point 1 and
already available at the installation shall be selected. However, where it is technically feasible to apply a data source
higher in the ranking without incurring unreasononable costs, such better data source shall be applied without undue
dalay. Where different data sources are available for the same data set at the same level in the ranking presented under
point 1, the data source which ensures the clearest data flow with lowest inherent risk and control risk regarding
misstatements shall be chosen.
4.
The data sources chosen under point 3 shall be used for the determination and reporting of embedded emissions.
5.
To the extent feasible without incurring unreasonable costs, for the purpose of the control system in accordance with
Section H of this Annex, additional data sources or methods for determining data sets shall be identified to allow
corroboration of data sources under point 3. The selected data sources, if any, shall be laid down in the monitoring
methodology documentation.
EN
Official Journal of the European Union
15.9.2023
L 228/145 6.
Recommended improvements: It shall be checked regularly, but at least once per year, whether new data sources have
become available, for the purpose of improving the monitoring methods. In the case that such new data sources are
considered more accurate in accordance with the ranking presented under point 1, they shall be laid down in the
monitoring methodology documentation and be applied from the earliest date possible.
7.
Technical feasibility: Where a claim is made that applying a specific determination methodology is technically not
feasible, a justification for this fact shall be laid down in the monitoring methodology documentation. It shall be
re-assessed during the regular checks in line with point 6. That justification shall be based on whether the installation
has technical resources capable of meeting the needs of a proposed data source or monitoring method that can be
implemented in the required time for the purposes of this Annex. Those technical resources shall include availability
of required techniques and technology.
8.
Unreasonable costs: Where a claim is made that applying a specific determination methodology for a data set incurs
unreasonable costs, a justification for this fact shall be laid down in the monitoring methodology documentation. It
shall be re-assessed during the regular checks in line with point 6. The unreasonable nature of the costs shall be
determined as follows.
Costs for determining a specific data set is considered unreasonable where the operator's cost estimation exceeds the
benefit of a specific determination methodology. To that end, the benefit shall be calculated by multiplying an
improvement factor with a reference price of EUR 20 per tonne of CO2e and costs shall include an appropriate
depreciation period based on the economic lifetime of the equipment, where applicable.
The improvement factor shall be:
(a) the improvement of estimated uncertainty in a measurement, expressed in per cent, multiplied with the estimated
related emissions over the reporting period. Related emissions means:
(1) the direct emissions caused by the source stream or emission source concerned;
(2) emissions attributed to a quantity of measurable heat;
(3) the indirect emissions related to the quantity of electricity concerned;
(4) embedded emissions of a material produced or of a precursor consumed;
(b) 1 % of the related emissions, where no improvement of measuring uncertainty is involved.
Measures relating to the improvement of an installation’s monitoring methodology shall not be deemed to incur
unreasonable costs up to an accumulated amount of EUR 2 000 per year.
A.4.
Division of installations into production processes
Installations shall be divided into production processes with system boundaries which ensure that relevant inputs, outputs
and emissions can be monitored in accordance with Sections B to E of this Annex and direct and indirect emissions can be
attributed to groups of goods defined in Section 2 of Annex II, by applying the rules of Section F of this Annex.
Installations shall be divided into production processes as follows:
(a) A single production process shall be defined for each of the aggregated goods categories defined in Section 2 of Annex
II that are relevant at the installation.
(b) By way of derogation from point (a), separate production processes shall be defined for each production route where
different production routes in accordance with Section 3 of Annex II for the same aggregated goods category are
applied in the same installation, or where the operator selects voluntarily different goods or groups of goods for
separate monitoring. A more disaggregated definition of production processes may also be used where it is in
accordance with an eligible monitoring, reporting and verification system applicable at the installation.

Official Journal of the European Union
L 228/146
15.9.2023 (c) By way of derogation from point (a), where at least a part of the precursors relevant for complex goods are produced in
the same installation as the complex goods, and where the respective precursors are not transferred out of the
installation for sale or use in other installations, the production of precursors and complex goods may be covered by a
joint production process. Separate calculation of embedded emissions of the precursors shall be omitted in that case.
(d) The following sectoral derogations from point (a) may be applied:
(1) Where two or more goods from the aggregated goods categories sintered ore, pig iron, FeMn, FeCr, FeNi, DRI,
crude steel, or iron or steel products are produced in the same installation, the embedded emissions may be
monitored and reported by defining one joint production process for all those goods.
(2) Where two or more goods from the groups unwrought aluminium or aluminium products are produced in the
same installation, the embedded emissions may be monitored and reported by defining one joint production
process for all those goods.
(3) For the production of mixed fertilisers, the monitoring and reporting for the respective production process may be
simplified by determining one uniform value of embedded emissions per tonne of nitrogen contained in the mixed
fertilisers, irrespective of the chemical form of nitrogen (ammonium, nitrate or urea forms).
(e) Where a part of the installation serves the production of goods not listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2023/956, it is
a recommended improvement to monitor that part as one additional production process for the purpose of
corroborating the completeness of the installation’s total emissions data.
B.
MONITORING OF DIRECT EMISSIONS AT INSTALLATION LEVEL
B.1.
Completeness of source streams and emission sources
The boundaries of the installation and its production processes shall be clearly known to the operator and defined in the
monitoring methodology documentation, taking into account the sector-specific requirements laid down in Section 2 of
Annex II as well as Section B.9 of this Annex. The following principles shall apply:
1. As a minimum, all relevant greenhouse gas emissions emission sources and source streams associated directly or
indirectly with the production of goods listed in Section 2 of Annex II shall be covered.
2. It is a recommended improvement to cover all emission sources and source streams of the total installation, in order to
perform plausibility checks and to control the energy and emissions efficiency of the installation as a whole.
3. All emissions from regular operations shall be included, as well as from abnormal events, including start-up, shut-down
and emergency situations, over the reporting period.
4. Emissions from mobile machinery for transportation purposes shall be excluded.
B.2.
Choice of monitoring methodology
The applicable methodology shall be either:
1. The calculation-based methodology, which consists in determining emissions from source streams on the basis of
activity data obtained by means of measurement systems and additional parameters from laboratory analyses or
standard values. The calculation-based methodology may be implemented according to the standard method or the
mass balance method.
2. The measurement-based methodology, which consists in determining emissions from emission sources by means of
continuous measurement of the concentration of the relevant greenhouse gas in the flue gas and of the flue gas flow.
By way of derogation, other methodologies may be used under the conditions specified in Articles 4(2), 4(3) and 5 of this
Regulation.
The monitoring methodology that gives the most accurate and reliable results shall be chosen, except where sector-specific
requirements in accordance with Section B.9 require one particular methodology. The applied monitoring methodology
may be a combination of methodologies such that different parts of the installation’s emissions are monitored by either of
the applicable methodologies.
EN
Official Journal of the European Union
15.9.2023
L 228/147 The monitoring methodology documentation shall clearly identify:
(a) for which source stream the calculation-based standard method or the mass balance method is used, including the
detailed description of the determination of each relevant parameter provided in Section B.3.4 of this Annex;
(b) for which emission source a measurement-based methodology is used, including the description of all relevant
elements provided in Section B.6 of this Annex;
(c) by means of a suitable diagram and process description of the installation, evidence that there is neither double
counting nor data gaps in the emissions of the installation.
The installation’s emissions shall be determined by
EmInst ¼ ∑
n
i¼1Emcalc;i þ ∑
m
j¼1Emmeas;j þ  ∑
l
k¼1Emother;k
(Equation 4)
Where:
EmInst
are the (direct) emissions of the installation expressed in tonnes CO2e;
Emcalc,i
are the emissions from source stream i determined using a calculation-based methodology expressed in tonnes
CO2e;
Emmeas,j
are the emissions from emission source j determined using a measurement-based methodology expressed in
tonnes CO2e; and
Emother,k
Emissions determined by another method, index k expressed in tonnes CO2e.
B.3.
Formulae and parameters for the calculation-based methodology for CO2
B.3.1.
Standard method
Emissions shall be calculated separately for each source stream as follows:
B.3.1.1. Combustion emissions
Combustion emissions shall be calculated using the standard method as follows:
Emi ¼ ADi • EFi • OFi
(Equation 5)
Where:
Emi
are the emissions [t CO2] caused by fuel i;
EFi
is the emission factor [t CO2/TJ] of fuel i;
ADi
is the activity data [TJ] of fuel i, calculated as:
ADi ¼ FQi • NCV i
(Equation 6)
FQi
is the fuel quantity consumed [t or m3] of fuel i;
NCVi
is the net calorific value (lower heating value) [TJ/t or TJ/m3] of fuel i;
OFi
is the oxidation factor (dimensionless) of fuel i, calculated as:
OF ¼ 1 – Cash=Ctotal
(Equation 7)
Cash
is the carbon contained in ash and flue gas cleaning dust; and
Ctotal
is the total carbon contained in the fuel combusted.
The conservative assumption that OF = 1 may always be used in order to reduce monitoring efforts.
EN
Official Journal of the European Union
L 228/148
15.9.2023 Provided that this leads to a higher accuracy, the standard method for combustion emissions may be modified as follows:
(a) the activity data is expressed as fuel quantity (i.e. in t or m3);
(b) the EF is expressed in t CO2/t fuel or t CO2/m3 fuel, as applicable; and
(c) the NCV may be omitted from the calculation. However, it is a recommended improvement to report NCV for allowing
consistency checking and monitoring of the energy efficiency of the whole production process.
If the emission factor of a fuel i is to be calculated from the analyses of carbon content and NCV, the following equation
shall be used:
EFi ¼ CCi • f =NCV i
(Equation 8)
If the emission factor of a material or fuel expressed in t CO2/t is to be calculated from an analysed carbon content, the
following equation is used:
EFi ¼ CCi • f
(Equation 9)
Where:
f
is the ratio of the molar masses of CO2 and C: f = 3,664 t CO2/t C.
As the emission factor of biomass shall be zero provided that the criteria given in Section B.3.3 are met, this fact may be
taken into account for mixed fuels (i.e. fuels which contain both fossil and biomass components) as follows:
EFi ¼ EFpre;i • ð1 – BFiÞ
(Equation 10)
Where:
EFpre,i
is the preliminary emission factor of fuel i (i.e. emission factor assuming the total fuel is fossil); and
BFi
is the biomass fraction (dimensionless) of fuel i.
For fossil fuels and where the biomass fraction is not known, BFi shall be set to the conservative value zero.
B.3.1.2. Process emissions
Process emissions shall be calculated using the standard method as follows:
Emj ¼ ADj • EFj • CFj
(Equation 11)
Where:
ADj
is the activity data [t of material] of material j;
EFj
is the emission factor [t CO2/t] of material j; and
CFj
is the conversion factor (dimension-less) of material j.
The conservative assumption that CFj = 1 may always be used in order to reduce monitoring efforts.
In the case of mixed process input materials which contain inorganic as well as organic forms of carbon, the operator may
choose either:
1. to determine a total preliminary emission factor for the mixed material by analysing the total carbon content (CCj), and
using a conversion factor and, where applicable a biomass fraction and net calorific value related to that total carbon
content; or
2. to determine the organic and inorganic contents separately and treat them as two separate source streams.
EN
Official Journal of the European Union
15.9.2023
L 228/149 Considering the available measurement systems for activity data and methods for determining the emission factor, for
emissions from the decomposition of carbonates, the method giving the more accurate results shall be chosen for each
source stream from the following two methods:
— Method A (Input-based): The emission factor, conversion factor and activity data shall be related to the amount of
material input into the process. The standard emission factors of pure carbonates as provided in Table 3 in Annex VIII
shall be used, taking into account the composition of the material as determined in line with Section B.5 of this Annex.
— Method B (Output-based): The emission factor, conversion factor and activity data shall be related to the amount of
output from the process. The standard emission factors of metal oxides after decarbonatisation as provided in Table 4
in Annex VIII shall be used, taking into account the composition of the relevant material as determined in line with
Section B.5 of this Annex.
For CO2 process emissions other than from carbonates, method A shall be applied.
B.3.2.
Mass balance method
The CO2 quantities relevant for each source stream shall be calculated based on the carbon content in each material,
without distinguishing fuels and process materials. Carbon leaving the installation in products instead of being emitted is
taken into account by output source streams, which have therefore negative activity data.
The emissions corresponding to each source stream shall be calculated as follows:
Emk ¼ f • ADk • CCk
(Equation 12)
Where:
ADk
is the activity data [t] of material k; for outputs, ADk is negative;
f
is the ratio of the molar masses of CO2 and C: f = 3,664 t CO2/t C; and
CCk
is the carbon content of material k (dimensionless and positive).
If the carbon content of a fuel k is calculated from an emission factor expressed in t CO2/TJ, the following equation shall be
used:
CCk ¼ EFk • NCV k=f
(Equation 13)
If the carbon content of a material or fuel k is calculated from an emission factor expressed in t CO2/t, the following
equation shall be used:
CCk ¼ EFk=f
(Equation 14)
For mixed fuels, meaning fuels which contain both fossil and biomass components or mixed materials, the biomass fraction
may be taken into account, provided that the criteria provided in Section B.3.3 are met as follows:
CCk ¼ CCpre;k • ð1 – BFkÞ
(Equation 15)
Where:
CCpre,k
is the preliminary carbon content of fuel k (i.e. emission factor assuming the total fuel is fossil); and
BFk
is the biomass fraction of fuel k (dimensionless).
For fossil fuels or materials and where the biomass fraction is not known, BF shall be set to the conservative value zero.
Where biomass is used as input material or fuel, and output materials contain carbon, the overall mass balance shall treat
the biomass fraction conservatively, meaning that the fraction of biomass in total output carbon shall not exceed the total
fraction of biomass contained in input materials and fuels, except if the operator provides evidence of a higher biomass
fraction in the output materials by a ‘trace the atom’ (stoichiometric) method or by 14C analyses.
EN
Official Journal of the European Union
L 228/150
15.9.2023 B.3.3.
Criteria for zero-rating of biomass emissions
Where biomass is used as a fuel for combustion, it shall fulfil the criteria of this section. Where the biomass used for
combustion does not comply with these criteria, its carbon content shall be considered as fossil carbon.
1. The biomass shall comply with the sustainability and the greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria laid down in
paragraphs 2 to 7 and 10 of Article 29 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.
2. By derogation from the previous point, biomass contained in or produced from waste and residues, other than
agricultural, aquaculture, fisheries and forestry residues shall fulfil only the criteria laid down in Article 29(10) of
Directive (EU) 2018/2001. This point shall also apply to waste and residues that are first processed into a product
before being further processed into fuels.
3. Electricity, heating and cooling produced from municipal solid waste shall not be subject to the criteria laid down in
paragraph 10 of Article 29 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.
4. The criteria laid down in paragraphs 2 to 7 and 10 of Article 29 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 shall apply irrespective of
the geographical origin of the biomass.
5. The compliance with the criteria laid down in paragraphs 2 to 7 and 10 of Article 29 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 shall
be assessed in accordance with Articles 30 and 31(1) of that Directive.
B.3.4.
Relevant parameters
In line with the formulae given in Sections B.3.1 to B.3.3 of this Annex, the following parameters shall be determined for
each source stream:
1. Standard method, combustion: Recommended improvement: Fuel quantity (t or m3), NCV (TJ/t or TJ/m3), Emission factor (t CO2/TJ), Oxidation
factor, Biomass fraction, evidence for meeting the criteria of Section B.3.3.
2. Standard method, process emissions: Recommended improvement: Activity data (t or m3), Emission factor (t CO2/t or t CO2/m3), conversion factor.
3. Mass balance: Recommended improvement: Material quantity (t), Carbon content (t C/t material), NCV (TJ/t), biomass fraction,
evidence for meeting the criteria of Section B.3.3.
B.4.
Requirements for activity data
B.4.1.
Continual or batch-wise metering
Where quantities of fuels or materials, including goods or intermediate products, have to be determined for a reporting
period, one of the following methods may be chosen and laid down in the monitoring methodology documentation:
1. based on continual metering at the process where the material is consumed or produced;
2. based on aggregation of metering of quantities separately (batch-wise) delivered or produced taking into account
relevant stock changes. For this purpose the following shall apply:
(a) the quantity of fuel or material consumed during the reporting period shall be calculated as the quantity of fuel or
material imported during the reporting period, minus the quantity of fuel or material exported, plus the quantity
of fuel or material in stock at the beginning of the reporting period, minus the quantity of fuel or material in stock
at the end of the reporting period;
EN
Official Journal of the European Union
15.9.2023
L 228/151 (b) the production levels of goods or intermediate products shall be calculated as the quantity exported during the
reporting period, minus the quantity imported, minus the quantity of product or material in stock at the beginning
of the reporting period, plus the quantity of product or material in stock at the end of the reporting period. For
avoiding any double counting, products of a production process returned into the same production process are
deducted from production levels.
Where it is technically not feasible or would incur unreasonable costs to determine quantities in stock by direct
measurement, those quantities may be estimated based on one of the following:
1. data from previous years and correlated with appropriate activity levels for the reporting period;
2. documented procedures and respective data in audited financial statements for the reporting period.
Where the determination of quantities of products, materials or fuels for the entire reporting period is technically not
feasible or would incur unreasonable costs, the next most appropriate day may be chosen to separate a reporting period
from the following one. It shall be reconciled accordingly to the reporting period required. The deviations involved for
each product, material or fuel shall be clearly recorded to form the basis of a value representative for the reporting period
and to be considered consistently in relation to the next year.
B.4.2.
Operator’s control over measurement systems
The preferred method for determining quantities of products, materials or fuels shall be that the operator of the installation
uses measurement systems under its own control. Measurement systems outside the operator’s own control, in particular if
under the control of the supplier of the material or fuel, may be used in the following cases:
1. where the operator does not have an own measurement system available for determining the respective data set;
2. where determining the data set by the operator’s own measurement system is technically not feasible or would incur
unreasonable costs;
3. where the operator has evidence that the measurement system outside the operator’s control gives more reliable results
and is less prone to risks of misstatements.
In the case that measurement systems outside the operator’s own control are used, applicable data sources shall be the
following:
(1) amounts from invoices issued by a trade partner, provided that a commercial transaction between two independent
trade partners takes place;
(2) direct readings from the measurement systems.
B.4.3.
Requirements for measurement systems
A thorough understanding of the uncertainty associated with metering quantities of fuels and materials, including the
influence of the operating environment and, where applicable, the uncertainty of stock determination shall be available.
Measuring instrauments shall be chosen that ensure the lowest uncertainty available without incurring unreasonable costs
and that are fit for the environment they are used in, in accordance with applicable technical standards and requirements.
If available, instruments subject to legal metrological control shall be preferred. In this case, the maximum permissible
error in service allowed by the relevant national legislation on legal metrological control for the relevant measuring task
may be used as the uncertainty value.
Where a measuring instrument needs to be replaced because of malfunction or because calibration demonstrates that
requirements are not met anymore, it shall be replaced by instruments that ensure meeting the same or a better
uncertainty level compared to the existing instrument.
EN
Official Journal of the European Union
L 228/152
15.9.2023 B.4.4.
Recommended improvement
It is considered a recommended improvement to achieve a measurement uncertainty comensurate with the total emissions
of the source stream or emission source, with lowest uncertainty for the biggest parts of the emissions. For orientation
purposes, for emissions of more than 500 000 t CO2 per year, the uncertainty over the full reporting period taking into
account stock changes, if applicable, shall be 1,5 % or better. For emissions below 10 000 t CO2 per year, uncertainty
lower than 7,5 % shall be acceptable.
B.5.
Requirements for calculation factors for CO2
B.5.1.
Methods for determining calculation factors
For the determination of calculation factors required for the calculation-based methodology, one of the following methods
may be chosen:
1. use of standard values;
2. use of proxy data based on a empirical correlations between the relevant calculation factor and other properties better
accessible to measurement;
3. use of values based on laboratory analysis.
Calculation factors shall be determined consistently with the state used for related activity data, referring to the fuel’s or
material’s state in which the fuel or material is purchased or used in the emission causing process, before it is dried or
otherwise treated for laboratory analysis. Where this incurs unreasonable costs or where higher accuracy can be achieved,
activity data and calculation factors may be consistently reported referring to the state in which laboratory analyses are
carried out.
B.5.2.
Applicable standard values
Type I standard values, shall be applicable only if no type II standard value is available for the same parameter and material
or fuel.
Type I standard values shall be the following:
(a) standard factors provided in Annex VIII;
(b) standard factors contained in the latest IPCC guidelines for GHG inventories (1);
(c) values based on laboratory analyses carried out in the past, not older than 5 years and considered representative for the
fuel or material.
Type II standard values, shall be the following:
(a) standard factors used by the country where the installation is located for its latest national inventory submission to the
Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change;
(b) values published by national research institutions, public authorities, standardisation bodies, statistical offices, etc. for
the purpose of more disaggregated emissions reporting than under the previous point;
(c) values specified and guaranteed by the supplier of a fuel or material where there is evidence that the carbon content
exhibits a 95 % confidence interval of not more than 1 %;
(d) stoichiometric values for the carbon content and related literature values for the net calorific value (NCV) of a pure
substance;
(e) values based on laboratory analyses carried out in the past not older than two years and considered representative for
the fuel or material.
(1) United Nations International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.
EN
Official Journal of the European Union
15.9.2023
L 228/153 In order to ensure consistency over time, any standard values used shall be laid down in the monitoring methodology
documentation, and only changed if there is evidence that the new value is more adequate and representative for the fuel
or material used than the previous one. Where the standard values change on an annual basis, the authoritative applicable
source of that value shall be laid down in the monitoring methodology documentation instead of the value itself.
B.5.3.
Establishing correlations for determining proxy data
A proxy for the carbon content or emission factor may be derived from the following parameters, in combination with an
empirical correlation determined at least once per year in accordance with the requirements for laboratory analyses given in
Section B.5.4 of this Annex as follows:
(a) density measurement of specific oils or gases, including those common to the refinery or steel industry;
(b) net calorific value for specific coal types.
The correlation has to satisfy the requirements of good industrial practice and may be applied only to values of the proxy
which fall into the range for which it was established.
B.5.4.
Requirements for laboratory analyses
Where laboratory analyses are required for determining properties (including moisture, purity, concentration, carbon
content, biomass fraction, net calorific value, density) of products, materials, fuels or waste gases, or for establishing
correlations between parameters for the purpose of indirect determination of required data, the analyses shall comply with
the requirements of this section.
The result of any analysis shall be used only for the delivery period or batch of fuel or material for which the samples have
been taken, and for which the samples were intended to be representative. When determining a specific parameter, the
results of all analyses made shall be used with regard to that parameter.
B.5.4.1. Use of standards
Any analyses, sampling, calibrations and validations for the determination of calculation factors shall be carried out by
applying methods based on corresponding ISO standards. Where such standards are not available, the methods shall be
based on suitable EN or national standards or requirements laid down in an eligible monitoring, reporting and verification
system. Where no applicable published standards exist, suitable draft standards, industry best practice guidelines or other
scientifically proven methodologies may be used, limiting sampling and measurement bias.
B.5.4.2. Recommendations on sampling plan and minimum frequency of analyses
The minimum frequencies for analyses for relevant fuels and materials listed in Table 1 of this Annex shall be used. Another
analysis frequency may be used in the following cases:
(a) where the table does not contain an applicable minimum frequency;
(b) where an eligible monitoring, reporting and verification system provides for another minimum analysis frequency for
the same type of material or fuel;
(c) where the minimum frequency listed in Table 1 of this Annex would incur unreasonable cost;
(d) where it can be demonstrated that based on historical data, including analytical values for the respective fuels or
materials in the reporting period immediately preceding the current reporting period, any variation in the analytical
values for the respective fuel or material does not exceed 1/3 of the uncertainty in determining the activity data of the
relevant fuel or material.
Where an installation operates for part of the year only, or where fuels or materials are delivered in batches that are
consumed over more than one reporting period, a more appropriate schedule for analyses may be chosen, provided that it
results in a comparable uncertainty as under the last point of the previous subparagraph.

Samples shall be representative for the total batch or time period of deliveries for which they are taken. In order to ensure
representativeness, the heterogenety of the material has to be taken into account, as well as all other relevant aspects such
as the avilable sampling equipment, possible segregation of phases or local distribution of particle sizes, stability of
samples, etc. The sampling method shall be laid down in the monitoring methodology documentation.
It is considered a recommended improvement to use a dedicated sampling plan for each relevant material or fuel, following
applicable standards, containing the relevant information on methodologies for the preparation of samples, including
information on responsibilities, locations, frequencies and quantities, and methodologies for the storage and transport of
samples.
B.5.4.3. Recommendations for laboratories
Laboratories used to carry out analyses for the determination of calculation factors shall be accredited in accordance
with ISO/IEC 17025, for the relevant analytical methods. Laboratories not accredited may be used for the determination of
calculation factors only where there is evidence that access to accredited laboratories is technically not feasible or would
incur unreasonable costs, and that the non-accredited laboratory is sufficiently competent. A laboratory shall be
considered sufficiently competent if it complies with all of the following:
1. it is economically independent of the operator, or at least organisationally shielded from influence by the management
of the installation;
2. it applies the applicable standards for the analyses requested;
EN
Official Journal of the European Union
15.9.2023
L 228/155 3. it employs personnel competent for the specific tasks assigned;
4. it appropriately manages the sampling and sample preparation, including control of sample integrity;
5. it regularly carries out quality assurance on calibrations, sampling and analytical methods, by suitable methods,
including regular participation in proficiency testing schemes, applying analytical methods to certified reference
materials, or inter-comparison with an accredited laboratory;
6. it manages equipment appropriately, including by maintaining and implementing procedures for calibration,
adjustment, maintenance and repair of equipment, and record keeping thereof.
B.5.5.
Recommended methods for determination of calculation factors
It is considered a recommended improvement to apply standard values only for source streams which correspond to minor
emission quantities, and to apply laboratory analyses for all major source streams. The following list presents the applicable
methods in sequence of increasing data quality:
1. type I standard values;
2. type II standard values;
3. correlations for determining proxy data;
4. analyses carried out outside the operator’s control, e.g. by the supplier of the fuel or material, contained in purchase
documents, without further information on the methods applied;
5. analyses in non-accredited laboratories, or in accredited laboratories, but with simplified sampling methods;
6. analyses in accredited laboratories, applying best practice regarding sampling.
B.6.
Requirements for a measurement-based methodology for CO2 and N2O
B.6.1.
General provisions
A measurement-based methodology requires the use of a Continuous Emission Measurement System (CEMS) installed at a
suitable measurement point.
For the monitoring of N2O emissions, the use of the measurement-based methodology, is mandatory. For CO2 it shall be
used only if there is evidence that it leads to more accurate data than the calculation-based methodology. The requirements
on uncertainty of measurement systems pursuant to Section B.4.3 of this Annex shall apply.
CO emitted to the atmosphere shall be treated as the molar equivalent amount of CO2.
Where several emission sources exist in one installation and cannot be measured as one emission source, the operator shall
measure emissions from those sources separately and add the results to obtain the total emissions of the gas in question
over the reporting period.
B.6.2.
Method and calculation
B.6.2.1. Emissions of a reporting period (annual emissions)
The total emissions from an emission source over the reporting period shall be determined by summing up over the
reporting period all hourly values of the measured greenhouse gas concentration multiplied by the hourly values of the
flue gas flow, where the hourly values shall be averages over all individual measurement results of the respective operating
hour, applying the formula:
GHG EMtotal½t ¼ ∑
HoursOp
i¼1
ðGHG conchourly;i • V hourly;iÞ • 10
– 6½t=g (Equation 16)
EN
Official Journal of the European Union
L 228/156
15.9.2023 Where:
GHG Emtotal
are the total annual GHG emissions in tonnes;
GHG conchourly,i
are the hourly concentrations of GHG emissions in g/Nm3 in the flue gas flow measured during operation
for hour or shorter reference period i;
Vhourly,i
is the flue gas volume in Nm3 for one hour or a shorter reference period i, determined by integrating the
flow rate over the reference period; and
HoursOp
are the total number of hours (or shorter reference periods) for which the measurement-based
methodology is applied, including the hours for which data has been substituted in accordance with
Section B.6.2.6 of this Annex.
The index i refers to the individual operating hour (or reference periods).
Hourly averages for each measured parameter shall be calculated before further processing, by using all data points available
for that specific hour. Where data for shorter reference periods can be generated without additional cost, those periods shall
be used for the determination of the annual emissions.
B.6.2.2. Determination of GHG concentration
The concentration of the GHG under consideration in the flue gas shall be determined by continuous measurement at a
representative point through one of the following: indirect measurement: in the case of high concentration in the flue gas, the concentration of the GHG may be calculated
using an indirect concentration measurement taking into account the measured concentration values of all other
components i of the gas stream, using the following formula:
GHG conc ½% ¼ 100 % – ∑i Conci½%
(Equation 17)
Where:

B.6.2.3. CO2 emissions from biomass
Where relevant, any CO2 amount stemming from biomass which complies with the criteria given in Section B.3.3 of this
Annex may be subtracted from the total measured CO2 emissions, provided one of the following methods is used for the
amount of biomass CO2 emissions:
1. a calculation-based methodology, including methodologies using analyses and sampling based on ISO 13833
(Stationary source emissions – Determination of the ratio of biomass (biogenic) and fossil-derived carbon dioxide –
Radiocarbon sampling and determination);
2. another method based on a relevant standard, including ISO 18466 (Stationary source emissions – Determination of
the biogenic fraction in CO2 in stack gas using the balance method);
3. another method allowed by an eligible monitoring, reporting and verification system.
B.6.2.4. Determining CO2e emissions from N2O
In the case of N2O measurements, the total annual N2O emissions from all emissions sources, measured in tonnes to three
decimal places, shall be converted to annual CO2e in rounded tonnes, using the following formula and the GWP values
given in Annex VIII:
CO2e [t] = N2Oannual[t] × GWPN2O
(Equation 18)
Where:
N2Oannual
is the total annual N2O emissions, calculated in accordance with Section B.6.2.1 of this Annex.

L 228/157 B.6.2.5. Determination of flue gas flow
The flue gas flow may be determined by one of the following methods:
— calculation by means of a suitable mass balance, taking into account all significant parameters on the input side,
including for CO2 emissions at least input material loads, input airflow and process efficiency, and on the output side,
including at least the product output and the concentration of oxygen (O2), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides
(NOx);
— determination by continuous flow measurement at a representative point.
B.6.2.6. Treatment of measurement gaps
Where the continuous measurement equipment for a parameter is out of control, out of range or out of operation for part
of the hour or reference period, the related hourly average shall be calculated pro rata to the remaining data points for that
specific hour or shorter reference period, provided that at least 80 % of the maximum number of data points for a
parameter are available.
Where fewer than 80 % of the maximum number of data points for a parameter are available, the following methods shall
be used.
— In the case of a parameter directly measured as concentration, a substitution value as the sum of an average
concentration and twice the standard deviation associated with that average is used, applying the following equation:
C

subst ¼ C þ 2 σc
(Equation 19)
Where:
C
is the arithmetic mean of the concentration of the specific parameter over the whole reporting period or, where
specific circumstances applied when data loss occurred, an appropriate period reflecting the specific
circumstances; and
σc
is the best estimate of the standard deviation of the concentration of the specific parameter over the whole
reporting or, where specific circumstances applied when data loss occurred, an appropriate period reflecting
the specific circumstances.
Where the reporting period is not applicable for determining such substitution values due to significant technical changes
at the installation, another sufficiently representative timeframe shall be chosen for determining the average and standard
deviation, where possible with the duration of at least 6 months.
— In the case of a parameter other than concentration, substitute values shall be determined through a suitable mass
balance model or an energy balance of the process. This model shall be validated by using the remaining measured
parameters of the measurement-based methodology and data at regular working conditions, considering a time period
of the same duration as the data gap.
B.6.3.

determination of velocity and volume flow rate in ducts).
EN
Official Journal of the European Union
L 228/158
15.9.2023 Where no applicable published standards exist, suitable draft standards, industry best practice guidelines or other
scientifically proven methodologies shall be used, limiting sampling and measurement bias.
All relevant aspects of the continuous measurement system shall be considered, including the location of the equipment,
calibration, measurement, quality assurance and quality control.
Laboratories carrying out measurements, calibrations and relevant equipment assessments for continuous measurement
systems shall be accredited in accordance with ISO/IEC 17025 for the relevant analytical methods or calibration activities.
Where the laboratory does not have such accreditation, sufficient competence in line with Section B.5.4.3 of this Annex
shall be ensured.
B.6.4.
Corroborating calculations
CO2 emissions determined by a measurement-based methodology shall be corroborated by calculating the annual
emissions of each greenhouse gas in question for the same emission sources and source streams. For this purpose, the
requirements laid down in Sections B.4 to B.6 of this Annex may be simplified as appropriate.
B.6.5.
Minimum requirements for continuous emissions measurements
As a minimum requirement, an uncertainty 7,5 % of the GHG emissions of an emission source over the full reporting
period shall be achieved. For minor emission sources, or under exceptional circumstances 10 % uncertainty may be
allowed. It is a recommended improvement to achieve an uncertainty of 2,5 % at least for emission sources emitting more
than 100 000 tonnes of fossil CO2e per reporting period.
B.7.
Requirements for determining perfluorocarbon emissions
Monitoring shall cover emissions of perfluorocarbons (PFCs) resulting from anode effects including fugitive emissions of
perfluorocarbons. Emissions not related to anode effects shall be determined based on estimation methods in accordance
with industry best practice, in particular guidelines provided by the International Aluminium Institute.
PFC emissions shall be calculated from the emissions measurable in a duct or stack (‘point source emissions’) as well as
fugitive emissions using the collection efficiency of the duct:
PFC emissions (total) = PFC emissions (duct)/collection efficiency
(Equation 20)
The collection efficiency shall be measured when the installation-specific emission factors are determined.
The emissions of CF4 and C2F6 emitted through a duct or stack shall be calculated by using one of the following methods:
1. method A where the anode effect minutes per cell-day are recorded;
2. method B where the anode effect overvoltage is recorded.
B.7.1.
Calculation Method A – Slope Method
The following equations for determining PFC emissions shall be used:
CF4 emissions [t] = AEM × (SEFCF4/1 000) × PrAl
(Equation 21)
C2F6 emissions [t] = CF4 emissions × FC2F6
(Equation 22)
Where:
AEM
is the anode effect minutes/cell-day;
SEFCF4
is the slope emission factor expressed in [(kg CF4/t Al produced)/(anode effect minutes/cell-day)]. Where
different cell-types are used, different SEF may be applied as appropriate;
PrAl
is the production of primary aluminium [t] during the reporting period; and
FC2F6
is the weight fraction of C2F6 [t C2F6/t CF4].
EN
Official Journal of the European Union
15.9.2023
L 228/159 The anode effect minutes per cell-day expresses the frequency of anode effects (number anode effects/cell-day) multiplied by
the average duration of anode effects (anode effect minutes/occurrence):
AEM = frequency × average duration
(Equation 23)
Emission factor: The emission factor for CF4 (slope emission factor, SEFCF4) expresses the amount [kg] of CF4 emitted per
tonne of aluminium produced per anode effect minute per cell-day. The emission factor (weight fraction FC2F6) of C2F6
expresses the amount [kg] of C2F6 emitted proportionate to the amount [kg] of CF4 emitted.
Minimum requirement: Technology-specific emission factors from Table 2 of this Annex are used.
Recommended improvement: Installation-specific emission factors for CF4 and C2F6 are established through continuous or
intermittent field measurements. For the determination of those emission factors industry best practice shall be applied, in
particular the most recent guidelines provided by the International Aluminium Institute. The emission factor shall also take
into account emissions related to non-anode effects. Each emission factor shall be determined with a maximum uncertainty
of ± 15 %. The emission factors shall be determined at least every three years or earlier where necessary due to relevant
changes at the installation. Relevant changes shall include a change in the distribution of anode effect duration, or a change
in the control algorithm affecting the mix of the types of anode effects or the nature of the anode effect termination routine.

Calculation Method B – Overvoltage Method
For the overvoltage method, the following equations shall be used:
CF4 emissions [t] = OVC × (AEO/CE) × PrAl × 0,001
(Equation 24)
C2F6 emissions [t] = CF4 emissions × FC2F6
(Equation 25)

is the overvoltage coefficient (‘emission factor’) expressed in kg CF4 per tonne of aluminium produced per
mV overvoltage;

industry best practice shall be applied, in particular the most recent guidelines provided by the International Aluminium
Institute. The emission factors shall be determined with a maximum uncertainty of ± 15 % each. The emission factors shall
be determined at least every three years or earlier where necessary due to relevant changes at the installation. Relevant
changes shall include a change in the distribution of anode effect duration, or a change in the control algorithm affecting

Requirements for CO2 transfers between installations
B.8.1.
CO2 contained in gases (‘inherent CO2’)
Inherent CO2 that is transferred into an installation, including that contained in natural gas, a waste gas (including blast
furnace or coke oven gas) or in process inputs (including synthesis gas), shall be included in the emission factor for that
source stream.
Where inherent CO2 is transferred out of the installation as part of a source stream to another installation, it shall not be
counted as emissions of the installation where it originates. However, where inherent CO2 is emitted (e.g. vented or flared)
or transferred to entities that do not themselves monitor emissions for the purpose of this Regulation or an eligible
monitoring, reporting and verification system, it shall be counted as emissions of the installation where it originates.
B.8.2.
Eligibility to deduct stored or used CO2
In the following cases CO2 originating from fossil carbon and originating from combustion or processes leading to process
emissions, or which is imported from other installations, including in the form of inherent CO2, may be accounted for as
not emitted:
EN
Official Journal of the European Union
15.9.2023
L 228/161 1. if the CO2 is used within the installation or transferred out of the installation to any of the following:
(a) an installation for the purpose of CO2 capture which monitors emissions for the purpose of this Regulation or an
eligible monitoring, reporting and verification system;
(b) an installation or transport network with the purpose of long-term geological storage of CO2 which monitors
emissions for the purpose of this Regulation or an eligible monitoring, reporting and verification system;
(c) a storage site for the purpose of long-term geological storage which monitors emissions for the purpose of this
Regulation or an eligible monitoring, reporting and verification system.
2. If the CO2 is used within the installation or transferred out of the installation to an entity which monitors emissions for
the purpose of this Regulation or an eligible monitoring, reporting and verification system, in order to produce
products in which the carbon stemming from CO2 is permanently chemically bound so that it does not enter the
atmosphere under normal use, including any normal activity taking place after the end of the life of the product, as
defined in the delegated act adopted pursuant to Article 12(3b) of Directive 2003/87/EC.
CO2 transferred to another installation for the purposes given in points 1 and 2 may be accounted for as not emitted only to
the extent evidence is provided across the whole chain of custody to the storage site or installation of CO2 use and including
any transport operators, of the fraction of CO2 actually stored or used for the production of chemically stable products
compared to the total amount of CO2 transferred out of the originating installation.
If CO2 is used within the same installation for the purposes in points 1 and 2, the monitoring methods given in Sections 21
to 23 of Annex IV to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 shall be applied.
B.8.3.
Monitoring rules for CO2 transfers
The identity and contact data of a responsible person of the receiving installations or entities shall be clearly laid down in
the monitoring methodology documentation. The amount of CO2 considered not emitted shall be reported in the
communication pursuant to Annex IV.
The identity and contact data of a responsible person of the installations or entities from which CO2 was received shall be
clearly laid down in the monitoring methodology documentation. The amount of CO2 received shall be reported in the
communication pursuant to Annex IV.
For the determination of the quantity of CO2 transferred from one installation to another, a measurement-based
methodology shall be used. For the amount of CO2 permanently chemically bound in products, a calculation-based
methodology shall be used, preferably using a mass balance. The chemical reactions applied, and all relevant
stoichiometric factors shall be laid down in the monitoring methodology documentation.
B.9.
Sector-specific requirements
B.9.1.
Additional rules for combustion units
Combustion emissions shall cover all CO2 emissions from the combustion of carbon-containing fuels, including wastes,
independent of any other classification of such emissions or fuels. Where it is unclear if a material acts as fuel or as process
input, e.g. for reducing metal ores, that material’s emissions shall be monitored the same way as combustion emissions. All
stationary combustion units shall be considered, including boilers, burners, turbines, heaters, furnaces, incinerators,
calciners, kilns, ovens, dryers, engines, fuel cells, chemical looping combustion units, flares, thermal or catalytic post-
combustion units.
Monitoring shall furthermore include CO2 process emissions from flue gas scrubbing, in particular CO2 from limestone or
other carbonates for desulphurisation and similar scrubbing, and from urea used in de-NOx units.
EN
Official Journal of the European Union
L 228/162
15.9.2023 B.9.1.1. Desulphurisation and other acid gas scrubbing
Process CO2 emissions from the use of carbonates for acid gas scrubbing from the flue gas stream shall be calculated on the
basis of carbonate consumed (Method A). In the case of desulphurisation, calculation may be based alternatively on the
quantity of gypsum produced (Method B). In the latter case, the emission factor shall be the stoichiometric ratio of dry
gypsum (CaSO4 × 2H2O) to CO2 emitted: 0,2558 t CO2/t gypsum.
B.9.1.2. De-NOx
If urea is used as reduction agent in a de-NOx unit, process CO2 emissions from its use shall be calculated using method A,
applying an emission factor based on the stoichiometric ratio of 0,7328 t CO2/t urea.
B.9.1.3. Monitoring of flares
When calculating emissions from flares, routine flaring as well as operational flaring (trips, start-up, and shutdown as well
as emergency relieves) shall be covered. Inherent CO2 in in the flared gases is to be included.
If more accurate monitoring is technically not feasible or would lead to unreasonable costs, a reference emission factor of
0,00393 t CO2/Nm3 shall be used, derived from the combustion of pure ethane used as a conservative proxy for flare gases.
It is a recommended improvement to determine installation-specific emission factors derived from an estimate of the
molecular weight of the flare stream, using process modelling based on industry standard models. By considering the
relative proportions and the molecular weights of each of the contributing streams, a weighted annual average figure shall
be derived for the molecular weight of the flare gas.
For activity data, higher measurement uncertainty than for other fuels combusted is acceptable.
B.9.2.
Additional rules for emissions from cement clinker production
B.9.2.1. Additional rules for Method A (input-based)
Where method A (kiln input-based) is used for determining process emissions, the following special rules shall apply:
— Where cement kiln dust (CKD) or bypass dust leave the kiln system, the related quantities of raw material shall not be
considered as process input. Emissions from CKD shall be calculated separately in accordance with Section B.9.2.3 of
this Annex.
— Either raw meal as a whole, or separate input materials may be characterised, avoiding double counting or omissions
from returned or by-passed materials. Where activity data is determined based on the clinker produced, the net
amount of raw meal may be determined by means of a site-specific empirical raw meal/clinker ratio. That ratio shall be
updated at least once per year applying industry best practice guidelines.
B.9.2.2. Additional rules for Method B (output-based)
Where method B (clinker output-based) is used for determining process emissions, the following special rules shall apply:
Activity data shall be determined as the clinker production [t] over the reporting period in one of the following ways: based on cement deliveries, by material balance taking into account dispatch of clinker, clinker supplies as well as
clinker stock variation, using the following formula:
Cliprod ¼ ðCemdeliv – CemSVÞ • CCR – Clis þ Clid – CliSV

CliSV
is the amount of clinker stock variations expressed in tonnes.
The clinker to cement ratio shall either be derived separately for each of the different cement products based on laboratory
analyses in line with the provisions of Section B.5.4 or calculated as ratio from the difference of cement deliveries and stock
changes and all materials used as additives to the cement including by-pass dust and cement kiln dust.
As minimum requirement to determine the emission factor, a standard value of 0,525 t CO2/t clinker shall be applied.
B.9.2.3. Emissions related to discarded dust
CO2 process emissions from bypass dust or cement kiln dust (CKD) leaving the kiln system, shall be added to the emissions,
corrected for a partial calcination ratio of CKD.
Minimum requirement: An emission factor of 0,525 t CO2/t dust shall be applied.

B.9.3.
Additional rules for emissions from nitric acid production
B.9.3.1. General rules for N2O measurement
N2O emissions shall be determined using a measurement-based methodology. N2O concentrations in the flue gas from each
emission source shall be measured at a representative point, after the NOx/N2O abatement equipment, where abatement is
used. Techniques capable of measuring N2O concentrations of all emission sources during both abated and unabated
conditions shall be applied. All measurements shall be adjusted to a dry gas basis where required and consistently reported.
B.9.3.2. Determination of flue gas flow
For monitoring flue gas flow, the mass balance method set out in Section B.6.2.5 of this Annex shall be used, unless it is
technically not feasible. In that case, an alternative method may be used, including by another mass balance method based
on significant parameters such as ammonia input load, or determination of flow by continuous emissions flow
measurement.
The flue gas flow shall be calculated in accordance with the following formula:

HEAT FLOWS
C.1.
Rules for determining net measurable heat
C.1.1.
Principles
All specified amounts of measurable heat shall always refer to net amount of measurable heat, determined as the heat
content (enthalpy) of the heat flow transmitted to the heat-consuming process or external user minus the heat content of
the return flow.
Heat-consuming processes necessary for operating the heat production and distribution, such as deaerators, make-up water
preparation, and regular blow offs, shall be taken into account in the efficiency of the heat system and shall be accounted
for in the embedded emissions of goods.
Where the same heat medium is used by several consecutive processes and its heat is consumed starting from different
temperature levels, the quantity of heat consumed by each heat-consuming process shall be determined separately, unless
the processes are part of the overall production process of the same goods. Re-heating of the transfer medium between
consecutive heat-consuming processes shall be treated like additional heat production.
Where heat is used to provide cooling via an absorption cooling process, that cooling process shall be considered as the
heat-consuming process.
C.1.2.
Methodology for determining net amounts of measurable heat
For the purpose of selecting data sources for quantification of energy flows in accordance with Section A.4 of this Annex,
the following methods for determining net amounts of measurable heat shall be considered:
C.1.2.1. Method 1: Using measurements
Under this method, all relevant parameters shall be measured, in particular temperature, pressure, state of the transmitted
as well as the returned heat medium. In the case of steam, the state of the medium shall refer to its saturation or degree of
superheating. The (volumetric) flow rate of the heat transfer medium shall be measured. Based on the measured values, the
enthalpy and the specific volume of the heat transfer medium shall be determined using suitable steam tables or
engineering software.
The mass flow rate of the medium shall be calculated as
_m ¼ _V=v
(Equation 30)
EN
Official Journal of the European Union
15.9.2023
L 228/165 Where:
_m
is the mass flow rate in kg/s;
_V
is the volumetric flow rate in m3/s; and
v
is the specific volume in m3/kg.
As the mass flow rate is considered the same for transmitted and returned medium, the heat flow rate shall be calculated
using the difference in enthalpy between the transmitted flow and the return, as follows:
_Q ¼ðhflow – hreturnÞ • _m
(Equation 31)
Where:
_Q
is the heat flow rate in kJ/s;
hflow
is the enthalpy of the transmitted flow in kJ/kg;
hreturn
is the enthalpy of the return flow in kJ/kg; and
_m
is the mass flow rate in kg/s.
In the case of steam or hot water used as heat transfer medium, where the condensate is not returned, or where it is not
feasible to estimate the enthalpy of the returned condensate, hreturn shall be determined based on a temperature of 90 °C.
If the mass flow rates are known to be not identical, the following shall apply:
(a) where evidence is available that condensate remains in the product (e.g. in ‘life steam injection’ processes), the
respective amount of condensate enthalpy is not deducted;
(b) where heat transfer medium is known to be lost (e.g. due to leakages or sewering), an estimate for the respective mass
flow is deducted from the mass flow of the transmitted heat transfer medium.
For determining the annual net heat flow from the above data, one of the following methods shall be used, subject to the
measurement equipment and data processing available:
(a) determine annual average values for the parameters determining the annual average enthalpy of the transmitted and
returned heat medium, multiplied by the total annual mass flow, using Equation 31;
(b) determine hourly values of the heat flow and sum up those values over the annual total operating time of the heat
system. Subject to the data processing system, hourly values may be substituted by other time intervals as appropriate.
C.1.2.2. Method 2: Calculation of a proxy based on measured efficiency
The amounts of net measurable heat shall be determined based on the fuel input and the measured efficiency related to the
heat production:
Q ¼ ηH • EIn
(Equation 32)
EIn ¼ ∑i ADi • NCV i
(Equation 33)
Where:
Q
is the amount of heat expressed in TJ;
ηH
is the measured efficiency of heat production;
EIn
is the energy input from fuels;
EN
Official Journal of the European Union
L 228/166
15.9.2023 ADi
are the annual activity data (i.e. quantities consumed) of the fuels i; and
NCVi
are the net calorific values of the fuels i.
The value of ηH is either measured over a reasonably long period, which sufficiently takes into account different load states
of the installation or taken from the manufacturer's documentation. In that regard the specific part load curve shall be taken
into account by using an annual load factor, as follows:
LF ¼
EIn
EMax
(Equation 34)
Where:
LF
is the load factor;
EIn
the energy input as determined using Equation 33 over the reporting period; and
EMax
the maximum fuel input if the heat producing unit had been running at 100 % nominal load for the full
calendar year.
The efficiency shall be based on a situation in which all condensate is returned. A temperature of 90 °C shall be assumed for
the returned condensate.
C.1.2.3. Method 3: Calculating a proxy based on the reference efficiency
This method is identical to method 3, but using a reference efficiency of 70 % (ηRef,H = 0,7) in Equation 32.
C.1.3.
Special rules
Where an installation consumes measurable heat produced from exothermic chemical processes other than combustion,
such as in ammonia or nitric acid production, that amount of heat consumed shall be determined separately from other
measurable heat and that heat consumption shall be assigned zero CO2e emissions.
Where measurable heat is recovered from non-measurable heat generated from fuels and used in production processes after
that use, e.g. from exhaust gases, for avoiding double counting, the relevant amount of net measurable heat divided by a
reference efficiency of 90 % is subtracted from the fuel input.
C.2.
Determining the fuel mix emission factor of measurable heat
Where a production process consumes measurable heat produced within the installation, the heat-related emissions shall be
determined using one of the following methods.
C.2.1.
Emission factor of measurable heat produced in the installation other than by cogeneration
For measurable heat produced from the combustion of fuels within the installation except heat produced by cogeneration,
the emission factor of the relevant fuel mix shall be determined and the emissions attributable to the production process
shall be calculated as:
EmHeat = EFmix · Qconsumed/η
(Equation 35)
Where:
EmHeat
is the heat-related emissions of the production process in t CO2;
EFmix
is the emission factor of the respective fuel mix expressed in t CO2/TJ including emissions from flue gas
cleaning, where applicable;
Qconsumed
is the amount of measurable heat consumed in the production process expressed in TJ; and
η
is the efficiency of the heat production process.
EFmix
shall be calculated as:
EN
Official Journal of the European Union

Waste gases:
The emissions caused by waste gases produced and fully consumed within the same production process are
included in DirEm*.
The emissions from the combustion of waste gases exported from the production process are fully included
in DirEm* irrespective of where they are consumed. However, for exports of waste gases the term WGcorr,export

account in DirEm*. Instead the term WGcorr,import shall be calculated;

installations, other production processes within the same installation, as well as heat received from a
technical unit (e.g. a central power house at the installation, or a more complex steam network with several
heat producing units) that supplies heat to more than one production process.
Emissions from measurable heat shall be calculated using the following formula:

during the reporting period for the goods listed in Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 by the aggregated goods category
according to Section 2 of Annex II to which the production process relates. Where production processes are defined such
that also the production of precursors is included, double counting shall be avoided by counting only the final products
leaving the system boundaries of the production process. Any special provisions laid down for the production process or
production route in Section 3 of Annex II shall be taken into account. Where several production routes are used at the
same installation for producing goods falling under the same CN code, and where those production routes are assigned
separate production processes, the embedded emissions of the goods shall be calculated separately for each production
route.
Only goods which can be sold or directly used as precursor in another production process shall be taken into account. Off-
spec products, by-products, waste, and scrap produced in a production process, irrespective of whether they are returned to
production processes, delivered to other installations, or disposed of, shall not be included in the determination of the
activity level. They shall therefore be assigned zero embedded emissions when entering another production process.
For determining activity levels, the metering requirements laid down in Section B.4 of this Annex apply.

Monitoring methods required for attributing emissions to production processes
F.3.1.
Principles for attributing data to production processes
1.
The methods chosen for attributing data sets to production processes shall be laid down in the monitoring
methodology documentation. They shall be regularly reviewed in order to improve the data quality, where
possible, in line with Section A of this Annex.
2.
Where data for a specific data set are not available for each production process, an appropriate method for
determining the required data for each individual production process shall be chosen. For this purpose, either of
the following principles shall be applied depending on which principle yields more accurate results:
(a) where different goods are produced one after the other in the same production line, inputs, outputs, and
corresponding emissions shall be attributed sequentially based on the usage time per year for each
production process;
(b) inputs, outputs, and corresponding emissions shall be attributed based on the mass or volume of individual
goods produced or estimates based on the ratio of free reaction enthalpies of the chemical reactions involved
or based on another suitable distribution key that is corroborated by a sound scientific methodology.
3.
Where several measuring instruments of different quality are contributing to measurement results, either of the
following methods may be used for splitting installation-level data on quantities of materials, fuels, measurable
heat, or electricity to production processes:
(a) Determination of the split based on a determination method, such as sub-metering, estimate, correlation, used
equally for each production process. Where the sum of the production process data is different from the data
determined separately for the installation, a uniform ‘reconciliation factor’ is applied for uniform correction to
meet the total figure of the installation as follows:
RecF = DInst /Σ DPP
(Equation 55)
Where:
RecF
is the reconciliation factor;
DInst
is the data value determined for the installation as a whole; and
DPP
are the data values for the different production processes.
The data for each production process are then corrected as follows, with DPP,corr being the corrected value of
DPP:
DPP,corr = DPP × RecF
(Equation 56)
(b) If only one production process’s data are unknown or of lower quality than the data of other production
processes, known production process data may be subtracted from the total installation data. This method is
preferred only for production processes which contribute smaller quantities to the installation’s allocation.
F.3.2.
Procedure for tracking CN codes of goods and precursors
For the purpose of correct attribution of data to production processes, the installation shall maintain a list of all goods and
precursors produced at the installation as well as of precursors obtained from outside the installation, and their applicable
CN codes. Based on this list:
1. products and their annual production figures shall be attributed to production processes in accordance with the
aggregated goods categories provided in Section 2 of Annex II;
2. this information shall be taken into account for attributing inputs, outputs, and emissions separately to production
processes.
EN
Official Journal of the European Union
L 228/176
15.9.2023 To this end a procedure shall be established, documented, implemented, and maintained for regular checking whether the
goods and precursors produced in the installation correspond to the CN codes applied when setting up the monitoring
methodology documentation. This procedure shall furthermore contain provisions to identify if the installation produces
new goods and to ensure that the applicable CN code for the new product is determined and added it to the list of goods
for attributing related inputs, outputs, and emissions to the appropriate production process.
F.4.
Further rules for the attribution of direct emissions
1.
Emissions of source streams or emission sources serving only one production process shall be attributed to that
production process in full. Where a mass balance is used, outgoing source streams shall be subtracted in
accordance with Section B.3.2 of this Annex. For avoiding double counting, source streams which are converted
into waste gases, with the exception of waste gases produced and fully consumed within the same production
process, shall be attributed using Equations 53 and 54. The necessary monitoring of the NCV and volume of the
respective waste gas shall be done by applying the rules given in Sections B.4 and B.5 of this Annex.
2.
Only where source streams or emission sources serve more than one production process, the following methods
for attribution of direct emissions shall apply:
(a) Emissions from source streams or emission sources used for the production of measurable heat shall be
attributed to production processes in accordance with Section F.5 of this Annex.
(b) Where waste gases are not used within the same production process in which they are produced, the
emissions stemming from waste gases shall be attributed in accordance with rules and equations given in
Section F.1 of this Annex.
(c) Where the amounts of source streams attributable to production processes are determined by metering before
the use in the production process, the appropriate methodology shall be applied in accordance with Section
F.3.1 of this Annex.
(d) Where emissions from source streams or emission sources cannot be attributed in accordance with other
methods, they shall be attributed using correlated parameters, which have already been attributed to
production processes in accordance with Section F.3.1 of this Annex. For that purpose, source stream
amounts and their respective emissions shall be attributed proportionally to the ratio in which those
parameters are attributed to production processes. Appropriate parameters include the mass of goods
produced, mass or volume of fuel or material consumed, amount of non-measurable heat produced,
operating hours, or known equipment efficiencies.
F.5.
Further rules for the attribution of emissions from measurable heat
The general calculation principles given in Section F.1 of this Annex shall apply. The relevant heat flows shall be determined
in line with Section C.1 of this Annex and the emission factor of measurable heat by applying Section C.2 of this Annex.
Where losses of measurable heat are determined separately from the amounts used in production processes, emissions
related to these heat losses shall be added proportionally to the emissions of all production processes in which measurable
heat produced in the installation is used, in order to ensure that 100 % of the quantity of net measurable heat produced
within the installation, or imported or exported by the installation, as well as quantities transferred between production
processes, shall be attributed to production processes without any omission or double counting.

are the specific direct or indirect embedded emissions of precursor i expressed in t CO2e per tonne of
precursor i.
In this calculation, only precursors not covered by the same production process as goods g are taken into account. Where
the same precursor is obtained from different installations, the precursor from each installation shall be treated separately.
Where a precursor i itself has precursors, those precursors are first taken into account using the same calculation method in
order to calculate the embedded emissions of the precursor i before they are used for calculating the embedded emissions of
goods g. This method is used recursively to all precursors which are complex goods.
The parameter Mi refers to the total mass of precursor required to produce the amount ALg. It also includes quantities of the
precursor which do not end up in the complex goods but may be spilt, cut off, combusted, chemically modified, etc. in the
production process and leave the process as by-products, scrap, residues, wastes, or emissions.
In order to provide data which can be used independently of activity levels, the specific mass consumption mi for each
precursor i shall be determined and included in the communication pursuant to Annex IV:
mi ¼ Mi=ALg
(Equation 59)
Thereby the specific embedded emissions of complex goods g may be expressed as:
SEEg ¼ aeg þ ∑
n
i¼1ðmi • SEEiÞ
(Equation 60)
Where:
aeg
are the specific attributed direct or indirect emissions of the production process yielding goods g, expressed
in t CO2e per tonne of g, being equivalent to specific embedded emissions without precursors’ embedded
emissions:
aeg ¼ AttrEmg=ALg
(Equation 61)
mi
is the specific mass consumption of precursor i used in the production process yielding one tonne of goods
g, expressed in tonnes of precursor i per tonne of goods g (i.e. dimensionless); and
SEEi
are the specific direct or indirect embedded emissions of precursor i expressed in t CO2e per tonne of
precursor i.
H.
OPTIONAL MEASURES TO INCREASE QUALITY OF DATA
1.
Sources of risks of errors are identified in the data flow from primary data to final data in the communication
pursuant to Annex IV. An effective control system is established, documented, implemented, and maintained to
ensure that the communications resulting from data flow activities do not contain misstatements and are in
conformity with the monitoring methodology documentation and in compliance with this Annex.
EN
Official Journal of the European Union
L 228/178
15.9.2023 The risk assessment pursuant to the first subparagraph is made available to the Commission and the competent
authority upon request. If the operator chooses to use verification in line with recommended improvements, the
operator also makes it available for the purposes of verification.
2.
For the purpose of the risk assessment, written procedures are established, documented, implemented, and
maintained for data flow activities as well as for control activities, and references to those procedures are included
in the monitoring methodology documentation.
3.
Control activities referred to in paragraph 2 shall include, where applicable:
(a) quality assurance of the relevant measurement equipment;
(b) quality assurance of information technology systems ensuring that the relevant systems are designed,
documented, tested, implemented, controlled and maintained in a way that ensures processing reliable,
accurate and timely data in accordance with the risks identified in the risk assessment;
(c) segregation of duties in the data flow activities and control activities, as well as management of necessary
competencies;
(d) internal reviews and validation of data;
(e) corrections and corrective action;
(f)
control of out-sourced processes;
(g) keeping records and documentation including the management of document versions.
4.
For the purposes of paragraph 3(a), it shall be ensured that all relevant measuring equipment is calibrated,
adjusted, and checked at regular intervals including prior to use, and checked against measurement standards
traceable to international measurement standards, where available, and proportionate to the risks identified.
Where components of the measuring systems cannot be calibrated, those components shall be identified in the
monitoring methodology documentation and alternative control activities shall be established.
When the equipment is found not to comply with required performance, necessary corrective action shall be
promptly taken.
5.
For the purposes of paragraph 3(d), data resulting from the data flow activities referred to in paragraph 2 shall be
regularly reviewed and validated. Such review and validation of the data shall include:
(a) a check as to whether the data are complete;
(b) a comparison of the data determined over the preceding reporting period and, in particular, consistency
checks based on time series of greenhouse gas efficiency of the relevant production processes;
(c) a comparison of data and values resulting from different operational data collection systems, in particular for
production protocols, sales figures and stock figures of relevant goods;
(d) comparisons and completeness checks of data at the level of the installation and production process of
relevant goods.
6.
For the purposes of paragraph 3(e), it shall be ensured that, where data flow activities or control activities are
found not to function effectively, or not to respect the rules set in the documentation of procedures for those
activities, corrective action is taken and affected data is corrected without undue delay.
7.
For the purposes of paragraph 3(f), where one or more data flow activities or control activities referred to in
paragraph 1 are outsourced from the installation, to all of the following shall be performed:
(a) checking the quality of the outsourced data flow activities and control activities in accordance with this
Annex;
EN
Official Journal of the European Union
15.9.2023
L 228/179 (b) defining appropriate requirements for the outputs of the outsourced processes as well as the methods used in
those processes;
(c) checking the quality of the outputs and methods referred to in point (b) of this paragraph;
(d) ensuring that outsourced activities are carried out such that those are responsive to the inherent risks and
control risks identified in the risk assessment.
8.
The effectiveness of the control system shall be monitored, including by carrying out internal reviews and taking
into account the findings of the verifier, if verification is applied.
When the control system is found ineffective or not commensurate with the risks identified, the control system
shall be improved and the monitoring methodology documentation updated accordingly, including the
underlying written procedures for data flow activities, risk assessments and control activities, as appropriate.
9.
Recommended improvement: the operator may voluntarily have the installation’s emissions data and specific
embedded emissions data of goods as compiled in accordance with Annex IV verified by an independent verifier
accredited to ISO 14065, or according to the rules of the eligible monitoring, reporting and verification system
relevant to the installation.

(1) The given emission factor assumes around 15 % water content of the wood. Fresh wood can have water content of up to 50 %. For
determining the NCV of completely dry wood, the following equation shall be used:
NCV ¼ NCV dry • ð1 – wÞ – ΔHv • w
Where NCVdry is the NCV of the absolute dry material, w is the water content (mass fraction) and ΔHv ¼ 2; 4GJ=t H2O is the
evaporation enthalpy of water. Using the same equation, the NCV for a given water content can be back-calculated from the dry NCV.
(2) The NCV value is taken from Annex III to Directive (EU) 2018/2001.
(3) For landfill gas, sludge gas and other biogas: Standard values refer to pure Biomethane. For arriving at the correct standard values, a
correction is required for the methane content of the gas.
(4) The IPCC guidelines also give values for the fossil fraction of municipal waste: EF = 91,7 t CO2/TJ; NCV = 10 GJ/t.
