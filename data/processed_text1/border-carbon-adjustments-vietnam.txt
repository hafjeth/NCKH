Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanisms and Impacts on Vietnam
1.0 Introduction to Border Carbon
Adjustments
Border carbon adjustments (BCAs) have become a hot topic in trade and environment
policy circles. The proximate reason is the European Union’s (EU’s) Carbon Border
Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) coming into law in May 2023. But the underlying reasons
are more fundamental. As the science of climate change becomes more unequivocal,
the impacts of climate change are being increasingly felt, and the cost of low-carbon
technologies comes down, governments are under increasing pressure to act. As one
indicator of those trends, in 2019, there were practically no net-zero pledges on the books
in any country, while today, national net-zero pledges are in place in countries accounting
for 88% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and 92% of global GDP  (Net Zero
Tracker, 2023). Forty of those countries have put their pledges into binding law.
As countries ramp up their climate ambitions, some will impose costs on producers
in emissions-intensive trade-exposed (EITE) sectors. If they do, they will be forced to
consider how to protect those sectors from carbon leakage.1 With no plan to address carbon
leakage, policy-makers risk the political fallout from fostering deindustrialization rather
than decarbonization. BCAs are one of only a few tools dedicated to this end, so it will be
increasingly considered.
1.1 What Are BCAs?
1.1.1 Levelling the Playing Field
BCAs, at a general level, are put in place to make imported goods bear the same carbon
costs that domestic goods must bear. They are usually aimed at EITE sectors such as steel,
aluminum, cement, fertilizers, plastics, and chemicals, and within those sectors, the focus
is upstream at basic and semi-processed materials (Centro de Estudos de Integração e
Desenvolvimento, 2024). Those energy-intensive, domestically produced goods will feel the
pinch of any carbon pricing, but since they are trade-exposed, their producers will find it
difficult to pass along any carbon costs to consumers, since international competitors may
not face similar costs.
That prospect risks carbon leakage, which can happen through firms relocating to other
jurisdictions, through losing market share to foreign producers, or through diverting
greenfield investment to other jurisdictions. Evidence is mixed on the existence of carbon
leakage at present, but it is widely agreed that as carbon prices become more meaningful,
the risk of leakage will increase.
1  Carbon leakage indicates an increase in GHG emissions in other jurisdictions in response to climate policies in
an implementing jurisdiction.

Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanisms and Impacts on Vietnam
1.1.2 Two Basic Types of BCAs
BCAs are not stand-alone mechanisms; they are designed to accompany some underlying
climate policy. Depending on the nature of that policy, they can take two basic forms:
•	 If the underlying policy is a carbon tax, a BCA would function like a border tax
adjustment, in most respects acting similarly to the value-added tax adjustment used
by many countries.
•	 If the underlying policy is a regulation, such as a requirement to purchase emissions
allowances under an emissions trading scheme, a BCA would seek to mirror the
domestic regulation with a regulation affecting imports—for example, requiring that
they also purchase emissions allowances.
These two basic forms give rise immediately to a host of World Trade Organization (WTO)
legal questions that will not be explored here. There are excellent resources that explore the
ways BCA might be treated under the WTO’s General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which
is applicable to taxes and regulations, and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing
Measures, which is applicable to tax rebates for exports.2
1.1.3 The BCA Decision Tree
Even within the basic two types of BCAs, there are many possible variations of the final result.
BCAs are less like a single policy and more like a decision tree, with the final result depending
strongly on choices made about policy options during the elaboration process. Some of the
basic choices include the following:
•	 Will it only assess a levy on imports, or will it also rebate carbon costs to exports?
•	 What goods/sectors will it cover? How far up and down the value chain will it extend in
covered sectors?
•	 How will embodied emissions be estimated at the border? Using actual data? Assumed
defaults? If the latter, can the defaults be challenged?
•	 What GHG emissions will be covered? Possibilities include direct emissions (Scope 1),
emissions from purchased electricity (Scope 2), or various types of Scope 3 emissions
(e.g., from purchased input goods or transport of goods).
•	 What price will be put on embodied emissions?
•	 Will the BCA exempt states from coverage based on national-level criteria like climate
ambition or development status?
•	 Will the BCA charge be lowered to account for a carbon price paid in the country of
export? What about non-price-based climate policies?
•	 What will be done with the revenues? Will any be transferred to the affected countries
or producers?
2  See, for example Espa et al., 2022; OECD, 2020, Section 3.1.2.
IISD.org

Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanisms and Impacts on Vietnam
The underlying climate policy instrument will determine many of these policy choices. For
example, if the instrument only covers direct (Scope 1) emissions, then the likely choice for a
BCA would be to cover the same emissions.
Other choices might be determined by the objectives that states have for implementing BCA.
Possible objectives include
•	 preventing leakage,
•	 protecting the competitiveness of domestic producers, and
•	 forcing other countries to strengthen their climate policies to reduce emissions.
For example, if the objective were simply to force other countries into greater ambition, then
there might not be a rationale for export rebates, but such rebates would likely be needed if
the objective were protecting competitiveness.
1.1.4 Judging BCAs
It is impossible to say in the abstract whether BCAs are effective, fair, and legal; this can only
be done in the context of a specific BCA. The answers will depend fundamentally on how the
BCA in question finally manifests due to the types of choices described above.
The implication is that BCAs could be designed as instruments in line with national and
international legal obligations that focus on environmental protection, but they also have the
potential to be protectionist instruments that focus on unfairly and illegally disadvantaging
foreign producers.
1.2 Challenges of BCAs and International Cooperation
BCAs present fundamental challenges both to countries contemplating using them as a policy
tool and to countries facing the prospect of having such a tool used by their trading partners.
1.2.1 Countries Considering a BCA
Countries exploring the possibility of using a BCA face a full measure of technical challenges,
including how to measure embedded carbon at the product level across different sectors,
how to account for the effective carbon price paid in exporting jurisdictions whose carbon
pricing regimes feature complexities such as offsets and allowances, and so on. There is also
the challenge of adapting the basic form of BCAs to the legal, political, environmental, and
economic realities to which the tool must be made appropriate.
At a higher level, the challenge is to craft a tool that balances a host of criteria that can be at
odds with one another: effectiveness at reducing leakage, respect for trade law obligations,
administrative feasibility, and respect for the development imperatives expressed in principles
such as common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Even more
broadly, the challenge is to craft a tool that ultimately is about protecting the environment as
opposed to punishing foreign competitors.
IISD.org

Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanisms and Impacts on Vietnam
Each of the basic design choices described above has points at which those challenges become
concrete forks in the decision tree that will determine a different endpoint. To explore whether
a BCA is an appropriate policy choice countries need to
consider the critical starting-point questions:
•	 What should be the objectives of a BCA regime?
•	 What national-level sectoral, environmental, legal, and political realities should inform
the elaboration of a BCA regime?
•	 What principles or best-practice guidance should guide the key choices designers make
in elaborating a BCA regime?
1.2.2 Countries Facing Foreign BCAs
The challenges are different in countries that are facing the prospect of their trading partners
adopting a BCA. As a starting point, they include how best to support their exporters in
understanding and complying with BCA provisions with the least possible impairment to their
competitiveness.
At a higher level, the challenges include how to influence the policy and design choices made
by their trading partners and how to ensure that their realities and concerns are considered.
As part of that challenge, a key question is how to help ensure that if there are multiple BCA
regimes, their various institutions, measurement, and reporting protocols are not divergent,
needlessly forcing exporters to conform to different requirements in regimes that have
essentially the same objectives. Another challenge is deciding what norms to use in assessing
and critiquing BCA regimes and proposals. Trade law offers one benchmark by which some
aspects of a BCA regime can be judged, but on many important design questions, it is not
particularly helpful.
Critical starting-point questions that each country should answer to address the possibility
that trading partners will adopt BCAs are:
•	 What are the country’s sectoral vulnerabilities to foreign BCAs? What are the potential
impacts?
•	 What channels exist to influence the adoption or design of foreign BCAs?
•	 What principles or best-practice standards could be used as benchmarks to judge the
design choices made by foreign designers in elaborating a BCA regime?
BCAs present fundamental challenges to both countries developing their own instruments
and those affected by them. However, some elements of their design might benefit from
much more active international discussions before individual BCA instruments take different
approaches that would make international trade more challenging and costly and international
relations even more tense than they currently are.

Topics could include the following:
•	 standards used for calculating embedded emissions,
•	 the scope of geographic BCA coverage and its exemptions,
•	 crediting foreign climate mitigation policies, and
•	 the use of revenues collected through BCA implementation.
While the list above is illustrative (but by no means not exhaustive), the international
community needs to engage on this topic earlier rather than later to help shape future
instruments in a way that ensures that their form meets their purpose in a way that is
compatible with their government’s international obligations and supportive of the global
efforts to reach the Paris Agreement targets.

2.0 Impacts of BCAs on Vietnam
2.1 The Context of Vietnam
Vietnam’s economy is growing rapidly (by 7.02% in 2019) and is transforming from an
agricultural economy to a manufacturing and export-oriented economy at a remarkable pace
(International Fund for Agricultural Development, 2019). As an export-oriented economy
with a high degree of trade openness, Vietnam is vulnerable to trade shocks, especially from
major trading partners such as the EU. As mentioned, while other countries are considering
and discussing the potentiality of applying a BCA, the EU is the first region to initiate
this mechanism to avoid carbon leakage and ensure its environmental commitments. The
EU’s CBAM entered into force in October 2023. The CBAM’s initially affected goods are
electricity, iron and steel, cement, aluminum, fertilizers, and hydrogen (Taxation Customs
Union, 2023).
Considering the export sectors of Vietnam affected by the EU’s CBAM, from 2017 to
2023, the average annual exports to the EU in total value and percentages of selected
sectors are as follows: iron and steel account for approximately USD 1.1 billion (12%);
aluminum accounts for around USD 48 million (7%); fertilizers have a small export volume
of about USD 0.2 million per year to the EU; and cement accounts for around USD 12
million (1%) of the export value to the EU (WTO Centre, 2023c). In 2022, Vietnam
exported approximately 8.397 million tonnes of various types of steel, with the export value
reaching USD 7.99 billion. Among these, the main export markets for Vietnam in terms of
export turnover were the EU and the United States, accounting for 18.37% and 10.57%,
respectively (Vietnam Steel Association [VSA], 2023b). For the aluminum industry, the
total export value amounted to USD 2,127.61 million in 2022, with approximately USD
307.66 million, equivalent to about 14.46%, exported to the EU (Vietnam Aluminum
Profile Association, 2023). Additionally, Vietnam is a major producer and exporter of
cement globally, with production capacity expected to exceed 100 million tonnes per year
(Vietnam Cement Association, 2023). Cement was Vietnam’s 44th most exported product
in 2022: export values of cement equalled USD 1.54 billion, making it the second-largest
exporter of cement in the world in 2022, after China (Observatory of Economic Complexity,
n.d.). Steel, aluminum, and cement are the three key export sectors of Vietnam that may be
affected by various BCAs, especially the current EU’s CBAM.
2.2 Impacts on Sectors Currently Exposed to BCAs
This report will analyze the four sectors of Vietnam that are currently exposed to BCAs—iron
and steel, cement, aluminum, and fertilizers, which are under the application of the EU’s
CBAM—and examine the potential effects of the CBAM on these sectors. Even though the
period from October 1, 2023, to the end of 2025 is only a reporting period—without incurring
any financial liabilities under the EU’s CBAM—export-related activities from these sectors
will still be affected by the mechanism. In addition to the cost of production, exporting
enterprises also have to bear additional administrative costs for monitoring, reporting, and IISD.org

verifying the carbon emissions in their products exported to the EU market.3 Moreover, the
effects of the CBAM on these sectors will serve as a foundation for the recommendations
given in this report to help Vietnamese enterprises effectively deal with not only the EU’s
CBAM but also BCAs implemented by other countries in the future.
2.2.1 The Iron and Steel Industry
The steel industry in Vietnam holds a particularly significant position in the country’s
economic development toward industrialization and modernization. It is a foundational
sector, providing input materials for vital economic sectors such as mechanical engineering,
supporting industries, and the defence industry. In addition, the development of the steel
industry strongly influences the process of economic restructuring and urbanization. It
impacts various areas, including political security, national defence, and socio-economic
stability within the country (Ha, 2023).
However, the steel industry faces numerous difficulties and challenges (Ha, 2023). The
competitive capacity of Vietnam’s steel industry remains relatively low, as the majority
of raw materials for steel production need to be imported. Moreover, while new large-
capacity steel mills are being constructed, existing steel billet production facilities mainly
have small capacities, outdated equipment, and high energy consumption, as well as posing
environmental pollution risks. Market conditions are volatile, with intense competition and
surplus, along with trade remedies initiated by other trading partners affecting domestic
steel prices,4 leading to market instability. Specifically, in December 2022, the production of
steel products reached 2.135 million tonnes, increasing by 16.95% compared to the previous
month yet decreasing by 21.3% compared to the same period in 2021. Sales of steel products
reached 2.159 million tonnes, increasing by 11.17% compared to the previous month but
decreasing by 13.6% compared to the same period in 2021 (VSA, 2023a).
After the EU–Vietnam Free Trade Agreement entered into force on August 1, 2020, Vietnam’s
steel exports to the EU market have consistently shown growth. In November 2021, the steel
industry entered the top list of export goods valued at USD 10 billion for the first time (Viet
3  Article 35(2) of the Regulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 May 2023
Establishing a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism requires information that shall be included in the CBAM
report accordingly:
“2. The CBAM report shall include the following information:
(a) the total quantity of each type of goods, expressed in megawatt-hours for electricity and in tonnes for other
goods, specified for each installation producing the goods in the country of origin;
(b) the actual total embedded emissions, expressed in tonnes of CO2e emissions per megawatt-hour of electricity
or for other goods in tonnes of CO2e emissions per tonne of each type of goods, calculated in accordance with the
method set out in Annex IV;
(c) the total indirect emissions calculated in accordance with the implementing act referred to in paragraph 7;
(d) the carbon price due in a country of origin for the embedded emissions in the imported goods, taking into
account any rebate or other form of compensation available.”
4  According to the statistics from the Trade Remedies Authority of Vietnam, by the end of August 2023,
steel exports from Vietnam had faced 234 trade remedy investigations from 24 countries. Among them, anti-
dumping investigations were the most common (129 investigations), followed by safeguards (47 investigations),
investigations to prevent the evasion of trade remedy measures (34 investigations), and subsidy investigations (24
investigations). (Industry and Trade Magazine, 2023c).

Hang, n.d.). Steel exports to the EU accounted for just 3.4% of the total steel exports in June
2020. However, after 2 years, this figure has increased to 20.51% (a sixfold increase). In the
first 8 months of 2023, Vietnam exported 7.38 million tonnes of steel to the EU, a 24.4%
increase compared to the same period the previous year (Chi Nhân, 2023). As described
in Figure 1, in 2022, the main export markets of Vietnamese steel products include the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) (42%), the EU (16%), the United States
(8%), South Korea (6%), Hong Kong (5%), and Taiwan (4%).
Figure 1. Top 10 export markets of Vietnam steel in 2022

As the second biggest importer of Vietnamese steel, once the implementation of the EU’s
CBAM is complete, imported steel products into the EU market will face challenges
competing in this market if Vietnamese steel enterprises do not plan to reduce their carbon
emissions in production.
According to Pohang and Steel Company (Posco)-Vietnam, the EU’s CBAM will be a trade
barrier and significantly affect the steel industry, requiring steel companies to cooperate and
find methods to deal with the situation. Posco-Vietnam is aiming to achieve carbon neutrality
by 2050. The company must reduce 50% of carbon emissions by 2040 to meet this goal. Even
though the company is adopting an advanced technique that produces steel without using
coal as a feedstock and uses hydrogen instead, Posco-Vietnam still affirms that it is a huge
challenge to become carbon neutral by 2050 (Lê Thúy, 2023).
This challenge is not only a concern for Posco-Vietnam but also for the steel industry
in general. The VSA also expressed its concern that if steel companies do not respond
appropriately to the EU’s CBAM, the volume of exports to the EU and the trade relationship
with the EU regarding steel products will be negatively affected. However, Vietnamese steel

companies are still unsure about the measures that should be taken because the CBAM is a
recent measure. The only method is to reduce the emissions, but it is a long-term solution,
not a short-term measure. The VSA and steel enterprises are taking measures to assess the
impacts of the EU’s CBAM on the industry, research solutions, and create a roadmap to
balance carbon emissions and steel production. Accordingly, from 2021 to 2025, the focus will
be on optimizing processes, energy, raw materials, and technological advancements to reduce
carbon emissions by 10% to 30%. From 2025 to 2030, low-carbon materials will be utilized,
and the proportion of hydrogen in steel plants will be increased to 30% to catch up with the
global trend. However, Vietnamese steel enterprises are not yet ready to deal with the CBAM.
In addition to difficulties in reducing carbon emissions, even if Vietnamese steel exporters
are aware of the implementation of the EU’s CBAM, this is still a new policy and they do not
have any prior experience in dealing with it. Therefore, there is a need for support from the
Vietnamese government to help steel companies become familiar with the CBAM and provide
consultations regarding effective methods to cope with the situation in a short period.
On the other hand, despite being a challenge, the CBAM is also a force driving the domestic
steel industry toward green production. In the future, both the EU and other markets will
tend to apply BCAs. Under the pressure to protect the environment, leading multinational
companies tend to issue environmental standards to select providers, who also require
Vietnamese companies to reduce carbon emissions to be part of their supply chains. Moreover,
the Vietnamese government commits to achieving net-zero in 2050. Therefore, green steel
production is inevitable in the long term for Vietnamese steel enterprises.
2.2.2 The Aluminum Industry
In Vietnam, the bauxite-aluminum industry has only been developing for over 10 years.
Therefore, the current situation in the aluminum industry is still challenging, where market
demand has significantly decreased and aluminum plants are running at below designed
capacity, leading to cash flow depletion (Song Ha, 2023). In recent years, the aluminum
industry’s capacity has begun to experience oversupply. Over the past few years, on average,
production has only reached 70% of the designed capacity, and the volume of goods produced
far exceeds both domestic and export market demand. In Q1/2023, plants were operating
at only 30%–40% of the designed capacity, primarily to sustain employment for workers,
resulting in low revenue and challenging cash flow (Phòng vệ thương mại – Trung tâm WTO,
2023). In addition, aluminum imported from China currently accounts for a significant share
of Vietnam’s aluminum market. The cheap aluminum imports from China have affected
domestic aluminum production and led to intense competition in the domestic market (H.
Nguyen, 2023).
In 2022, aluminum exports reached over USD 2.127 billion, with exports to the EU
accounting for over USD 307 million, representing 14.46% of the total, an increase of three
times compared to 5% of the total in 2019 (H. Nguyen, 2023). As a result, it is estimated
that the implementation of the EU’s CBAM will decrease exports by more than 4% in
value and 0.4% in quantity in 2030 (Nguyet Ha, 2024). Also, the green transition is still
a big challenge for Vietnamese aluminum enterprises. It requires aluminum enterprises
to strategize and adapt to new requirements for green transformation. Enterprises can IISD.org
10
Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanisms and Impacts on Vietnam
integrate clean energy into production to enhance the value of aluminum products, then
increase commercial competitiveness and avoid carbon taxation, not only from the EU but
also from future trading partners.
2.2.3 The Cement Industry
According to a report issued by the United States Geological Survey in 2022, Vietnam’s
cement production capacity reached approximately 100 million tonnes, ranking third globally.
Specifically, the total cement consumption in the domestic market in 2022 amounted to 62.68
million tonnes, accounting for more than 62% of the total production. This figure remained
unchanged compared to 2021.
Figure 2. Top cement-producing countries in 2022
Source: United States Geological Survey, 2022.
Currently, Vietnam has over 103 cement production lines within 63 plants with a total
capacity of about 100 million tonnes per year. This number is expected to increase more
with several ongoing projects. The industry’s total designed capacity is expected to reach 123
million tonnes per year once these projects are completed (T. Nguyen, 2023).
However, 2023 is marked as the most challenging year for cement consumption in the over
120-year history of Vietnam’s cement industry. The decrease in domestic consumption is due
to a reduction in demand, a frozen real estate market, and a slight decline in public investment
compared to the same period in 2022, while the designed capacity has increased (T. Nguyen,
2023). Exports also faced difficulties in the first 6 months of 2023. Cement exports in the first
half of 2023 reached 14 million tonnes, a 15% decrease compared to the same period in the
previous year.
Vietnam ranks among the five largest cement producers and exporters globally, leading to
concern that the EU’s CBAM might pose a new barrier to this industry. Nevertheless, the
level of impact is insignificant as, over the past 5 years, exports of this construction material to
the EU accounted for less than 2% of the total cement export volume (as illustrated in Figure
3). However, this industry is still required to transition to green production and reduce carbon
emissions to not only deal with BCAs implemented by trading partners but also be consistent
with the government’s net-zero commitment by 2050.

2.2.4 Fertilizers
As of 2023, Vietnam had over 800 fertilizer production facilities. The domestic demand for
fertilizer usage amounts to around 10.5 million tonnes per year, with approximately 7.6
million tonnes of inorganic fertilizers (Duong, 2023).
Even though Vietnamese fertilizer production facilities produce and export fertilizers, Vietnam
has not exported fertilizer products covered under the CBAM (inorganic fertilizers) to the EU.
Moreover, the export value of Vietnam’s fertilizers to the EU is only roughly USD 0.2 million
per year (Duong, 2023). Therefore, the implementation of the CBAM may not directly or
significantly affect this industry. However, Vietnamese fertilizer enterprises still need to reduce
GHG emissions during the production process to be well-prepared in case these are indirectly
affected by the CBAM, given that they are part of a transnational fertilizer supply chain. For a
long-term plan, reducing GHG emissions during the fertilizer production process can not only
contribute to Vietnam’s national emissions-reduction goal but also facilitate the export of any
fertilizers to the EU in the future (Duong, 2023).
2.3 Impacts on Other Sectors Potentially Exposed to BCAs
As mentioned, under the current regime of the EU’s CBAM, only four industry sectors of
Vietnam could be affected while exporting their products to the EU market. However, in the
longer term, a wider range of Vietnamese industry sectors might be exposed to the CBAM or
similar BCA policies in two ways: i) the extension of the scope of the EU’s CBAM and ii) the
implementation by other countries of similar BCA policies.
First, regarding the extension of the scope of the CBAM, in the future, it could cover some
other products and services that are subject to the EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS).
Notably, the products and services covered by the current EU ETS, reinforced by the reform
to increase its ambition in 2023, include over 30 activities and sectors (Annex I and III, ETS

Directive), including combustion of fuels in installations; oil refining; production of coke;
production of metal ore; production of iron and steel; production and processing of ferrous
metals; production of primary aluminum or alumina; production of secondary aluminum;
production or processing of non-ferrous metal; production of cement clinker; production of
lime or calcination of dolomite or magnesite; manufacture of glass; manufacture of ceramic
products; manufacture of mineral wool; drying or calcination of gypsum; production of pulp;
production of paper; production of carbon black; production of nitric acid; production of
adipic acid; production of glyoxal and glyoxylic acid; production of ammonia; production
of bulk organic; production of hydrogen; production of soda ash and sodium bicarbonate;
capture of GHGs from installations; transport of GHGs; geological storage of GHGs; and
aviation and maritime transport.
Notably, goods under the EU ETS that are not at high risk of carbon leakage may not be
covered by the EU’s CBAM. Some other industries at high risk of carbon leakage—for
instance, plastics, organic chemicals, glass, and ceramics—are envisaged to be incorporated
into the future EU’s CBAM, regardless of their country of origin (Monkelbaan, & Figures,
2022). The CBAM would also ensure that importers of related imported products pay for
the carbon emissions associated with their production or processing. This extension would
incentivize enterprises to reduce their carbon footprint and encourage a transition to the use
of low-carbon emission technologies.
Therefore, in addition to the current four sectors exposed to the CBAM, other Vietnamese
sectors could be affected by the possible expansion of this policy in the future. These may
include plastics, glass, and ceramics in particular.
Second, other countries might consider implementing the same policy as CBAM. For the
time being, Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, and the United States intend
to apply BCAs in the future. Until now, their regulations related to this subject matter have
not been promulgated, even though countries like the United Kingdom have published their
draft regulations on the BCA for consultations. Therefore, it is not easy to foresee exactly the
impact of these BCA policies on Vietnam’s exports. However, published information allows us
to share some findings below.
In the case of Canada, based on the formal public consultation completed in 2021, it was
indicated that BCAs would be most relevant to the products made by EITE sectors, as they
are the most at risk of carbon leakage (Government of Canada, 2021). These EITE sectors
include oil and gas; mining; food and beverage; wood, pulp, and paper; chemicals; petroleum
and coal products; motor vehicle and parts; primary and fabricated metals; plastics and rubber
products; aerospace products and parts; non-metallic mineral products and transportation
of natural gas (Government of Canada, 2021). Of Canada’s total imported goods, 46.3%
are products competing with EITE production in Canada, amounting to CAD 269 billion
annually. Ten major Vietnamese export products to Canada in 2019 are electrical machines
and equipment, footwear, clothing and textiles, machinery and mechanical equipment,
furniture, seafood, leather and leather products, iron and steel, toys, games, and sports
equipment. Therefore, some sectors that could be covered by Canada’s future BCA and
impact Vietnam would include iron and steel, furniture products, etc.

In December 2023, the British government indicated its intention to apply an equivalent to
the EU’s CBAM for products in sectors subject to the United Kingdom’s ETS and at risk of
carbon leakage. Targeted sectors in the consultation draft that the United Kingdom released
include iron, steel, aluminum, fertilizer, hydrogen, ceramics, glass, and cement. Among
Vietnam’s major products exported to the United Kingdom, iron and steel products would
first be affected by the United Kingdom’s future CBAM (HM Treasury, 2023).

3.0 Responses to BCAs by Vietnamese
Stakeholders
With the implementation of the EU’s CBAM and other BCAs, the Vietnamese government,
industries, and academics have different perspectives to share regarding the impacts of
these BCA policies on Vietnam. In preparation for this Vietnam report on BCAs, two
stakeholders’ dialogues (SHDs) were held in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City on March 18
and April 20, 2024, respectively. The dialogues focused on presentations and roundtable
discussions with different stakeholders (i.e., representatives from the government, industry,
and academia) to solicit their analysis and views on opportunities and challenges generated
by BCA mechanisms in general and particularly the EU’s CBAM. The analysis outlined
below demonstrates the main points of discussion during the two dialogues and information
from official sources, news websites, and statements from experts from relevant departments
and ministries of Vietnam.
3.1 From the Government
SHD participants from Vietnamese government agencies have assessed that BCAs have
macroeconomic impacts on Vietnam. This section provides an overview of some general
impacts to consider.
First, applying BCAs worldwide creates pressure to force the Vietnamese government to
develop corresponding mechanisms, implement policies, and carry out specific actions to
protect the environment and reduce GHG emissions. As such, the government needs to build
mechanisms and policies, carry out investment activities in new technology, and develop
instruments to foster domestic carbon pricing and a clean energy transition.
Second, once BCAs have been applied, Vietnam would be able to benefit from reduced social
costs derived from reducing GHG emissions of large-emitting enterprises and production
facilities.
Third, through the implementation of carbon pricing instruments, such as a carbon tax and
other revenues from the carbon market, the government could benefit from increased revenue
for the state budget.
Fourth, BCAs’ application would help promote emission reduction in Vietnam, thereby
contributing to the goal of reducing GHG emissions following Vietnam’s nationally
determined contribution (NDC), which aims for net-zero emissions by 2050.
In addition, the specific impacts of BCAs’ application on Vietnam’s policies and laws could be
seen from two main angles.
3.1.1 Existing Policies
SHD participants from some of Vietnam’s government agencies indicated that in response
to the BCAs, Vietnam fostered the completion of the legal basis to reduce GHG emissions, IISD.org
15
Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanisms and Impacts on Vietnam
carbon pricing, carbon market development, and carbon credit issuance. These serve as a
premise to orient and promote industries and businesses that have expressed their willingness
to effectively reduce carbon emissions.
Since 2012, Vietnam has actively participated in and prepared for the process of forming
and developing the domestic carbon market, moving toward regional and world integration.
When the global climate change response moved into a new phase, with the parties starting to
implement the Paris Agreement in 2022, including contributions to reducing GHG emissions
committed in the NDC, Vietnam completed its updated NDC and sent it to the Secretariat
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Accordingly, by 2030,
using domestic resources, Vietnam will reduce total GHG emissions by 9% compared to
the national business-as-usual scenario, equivalent to 83.9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide
(CO2). In recent years, Vietnam has entered the carbon market as a provider of emission
reduction certificates and has made clear progress.
Participants also emphasized that the Law on Environmental Protection 2020, Decree
06/2022/ND-CP, and Circular 01/2022/TT-BTNMT have specified regulations to respond to
climate change, reduce GHG emissions, and promote the development of the domestic carbon
market. Accordingly, facilities with annual GHG emissions of 3,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent
or more or falling into one of the specific cases5 are all subject to a GHG inventory and must
develop and implement a plan to reduce GHG emissions according to the allocated quota.
Decree No. 06/2022/ND-CP regulates GHG emission mitigation and ozone layer protection
and has a specific development roadmap and timeline to deploy the carbon market.
Specifically, in the period until the end of 2027, Vietnam will (i) develop regulations on carbon
credit management, activities of exchanging GHG emission quotas and carbon credits; (ii)
develop regulations for operating the carbon credit exchange and pilot the implementation of
carbon credit exchange and offset mechanisms in potential areas, guiding the implementation
of domestic and international carbon credit exchange and offset mechanisms per the
provisions of law and treaties of international organizations of which Vietnam is a member;
(iii) establish and organize the pilot operation of a carbon credit exchange from 2025; and (iv)
implement capacity-building activities and raise awareness about carbon market development.
In addition, Vietnam has implemented projects under the Clean Development Mechanism in
which Vietnamese businesses have received technology transfer and financial resources from
exchanging and selling carbon credits.
Vietnam is also comprehensively transforming the domestic economy to achieve net-
zero carbon emissions by 2050, using businesses in key sectors as the driving force for
transformation. Decision No. 888/QD-TTg, dated July 25, 2022, of the Prime Minister
approving the project on tasks and solutions to implement the results of the 26th Conference
of the Parties (COP 26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
stipulates the tasks of prioritizing the implementation of carbon pricing tools, encouraging
5  These cases include thermal power plants; industrial production facilities with total energy consumption of 1,000
tonnes of oil equivalent (TOE)/year or more; road freight transport companies with total fuel consumption of
1,000 TOE/year or more; commercial buildings with total energy consumption of 1,000 TOE/year or more; and
solid waste treatment facilities with an operating capacity of 65,000 tonnes/year or more.

investment in reducing GHG emissions in areas/industries, developing renewable energy
sources, harvesting technology, and carbon storage and use.
Moreover, Vietnam has been implementing the National Strategy on Climate Change for the
period up to 2050 under Decision 896/QD-TTg (Prime Minister of Vietnam, 2022). The tasks
of reducing GHG emissions in industrial processes and the use of industrial products include
improving, developing, and applying technology in the production of construction
materials; developing and using energy-saving construction materials and green
materials in the housing and commercial sectors; implementing solutions for blast
furnace slag grinding, fly ash grinding, Puzzolana grinding, and alternative limestone
grinding, reducing the clinker ratio in cement production; applying high-temperature
decomposition technology and new technologies to reduce N2O emissions in the
chemical field; applying carbon capture technology in the fields of cement production,
chemicals – fertilizers, and steelmaking; applying molten oxide electrolysis technology
in the steelmaking field; using hydrogen to replace coke in “green” steelmaking  from
2035. (Prime Minister of Vietnam, 2022)
Electricity, iron and steel, fertilizer, aluminum, cement, and energy industries have been
selected as key priority sectors in implementing the solutions and measures to reduce GHG
emissions that the strategy has proposed in the short and long terms.
3.1.2 Future Policies, as Suggested by Stakeholders
The analysis below is based on points of discussion suggested by the SHD participants and
other sources of information in Vietnam.
Most of Vietnam’s existing policies target reducing GHG emissions in general and particularly
in those sectors that are subject to BCA measures. Despite the possible negative impacts on
Vietnam’s selected export industries in the short run, the CBAM also aligns with Vietnam’s
vision for a macroeconomy oriented toward sustainable development with green industries at
the core. In the medium to long term, it is envisaged that other trading partners may follow
suit; hence, such BCA measures could stand as a motivation for Vietnam to transition its
national export industries toward carbon reduction or elimination. In any case, reducing
carbon emissions will help Vietnam cope with the CBAM and the like and enable the country
to move forward in its national strategy on climate change to achieve its net-zero pledge by
2050. On such a basis, some additional policies could be envisaged.
First, supporting Vietnamese companies exporting products to trading partners
implementing BCAs remains crucial. Vietnam could raise awareness and educate
Vietnamese enterprises about the impacts of CBAM and the like, helping them to prepare
and develop their internal strategies to deal with BCA measures right from the beginning
stages. According to the CBAM Impact Assessment Project (Trung tâm WTO, 2023b),
although European importers are responsible for reporting on and bearing CBAM fees,
they will require Vietnamese manufacturers to provide information on product quantities,
emissions in products, costs paid for domestic carbon pricing, etc. Currently, Vietnamese
enterprises can only provide emission information about the production and processing of IISD.org
17
Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanisms and Impacts on Vietnam
goods; however, the CBAM requires emissions data information on both production and
certain inputs from across the supply chain.
Second, Vietnam is encouraged to take further steps to negotiate and engage in constructive
dialogues with the EU and other trading partners to clarify the scope or possible expansion
of BCA measures to other exported goods from Vietnam. At the same time, negotiation and
dialogues could also aim to set favourable conditions, provide detailed guidelines, and help
strengthen the technical and institutional capacity of Vietnamese enterprises to adapt to the
CBAM or other BCA measures.
Third, establishing a carbon pricing mechanism and carbon credit market could greatly
facilitate the ability of the CBAM or other BCA measures to credit specific sectors where
carbon prices have been paid during the production of imported goods. This condition,
however, largely depends on the extent to which carbon prices have been paid. Enterprises
will still have to pay the difference if the paid price is lower than the price of the EU ETS
allowances. With a clear carbon pricing mechanism from third countries like Vietnam, EU
importers can then deduct the corresponding amount equivalent to carbon prices from their
final invoice once they can prove, based on verified information from manufacturers, that
carbon prices have been paid in the exporting countries. In such a way, such an amount helps
increase the national budget of exporting countries since the carbon tax that would have
been paid to the importing country (e.g., the EU) could be retained in the exporting country
(e.g., Vietnam); meanwhile, both exporters and importers could benefit because exports
incur a lower carbon fee than, for example, the EU standard price. To date, Vietnam has been
preparing to establish a carbon credit market to help realize the national strategy goals on
climate change.
Fourth, it remains necessary for Vietnam to continue developing sustainable and green
industries for a general long-term goal toward the achievement of net-zero commitments by
2050, as pledged by the Prime Minister during COP 26 (Dezan Shira & Associates, 2021). To
materialize such a pledge, Vietnam has strived to develop decarbonization policies, including
phasing out coal power, promoting renewable energy, and energy-saving policies. In particular,
Vietnam has issued the Power Development Plan VIII (Giang, 2023), with a primary objective
of transitioning to green energy. This latest Power Development Plan includes a structure of
green energy sources that overwhelmingly surpasses coal power, demonstrating Vietnam’s
commitment to green initiatives. These government efforts could greatly help enterprises in
CBAM-affected sectors reduce carbon emissions in their production processes, thereby paying
less in CBAM charges when exporting to this market.
Fifth, the Vietnamese government should be proactive in observing countries’ responses
and behaviours other than the EU, focusing on some key partners of Vietnam or potential
countries that could apply BCA to promote and prepare for long-term policies toward a green
economy aligned with the global vision.
Finally, in response to the foreign BCAs, some SHD participants suggested that Vietnam
establish and implement a mechanism like BCAs to be applied to products imported from
other countries.

3.2 From Industry
The notable common view from participants of Vietnamese industries affected by BCAs is the
willingness to meet the requirements of BCAs, including the EU’s CBAM. They believe that
CBAM may have some incompatibility points with WTO or the European Union–Vietnam
Free Trade Agreement regulations; yet resolving those issues through the corresponding
dispute settlement mechanism might be lengthy and could result in losing export markets.
At the same time, when participating in the supply chains, businesses are required by foreign
partners to meet the requirements of importing countries. According to Mr. Nguyễn Cảnh
Cường, Commercial Counsellor at the Vietnam Trade Office in the United Kingdom, the
production and export of products, such as cast iron, steel, aluminum, cement, and fertilizers
from developing countries (including Vietnam), will face difficulties (Trung tâm WTO,
2023a). The competitive advantage gained from cheaper electricity and lower environmental
protection costs will diminish due to the newly incurred cross-border carbon tax. “The
effectiveness of FTAs will be somewhat reduced for export products from these industries.
Low-emission industries will have growth opportunities, while high-emission industries will
decline. Products from these sectors will experience corresponding changes,” Mr. Cường
concluded. Table 1 summarizes the estimated impacts of the EU’s CBAM regulation (as of
March 2023) on Vietnam in 2030 for some key sectors (Trung tâm WTO, 2023c).

Note: The “-” sign indicates a decrease compared to the trend scenario when CBAM starts being
implemented in 2026 (all other conditions remaining unchanged); the “+” sign indicates an increase.
Participants from the industries to the SHDs also pointed out that because the CBAM is still
quite new and the EU itself is in a “guiding stage,” they have difficulty understanding and
completing the forms that the EU provides. Therefore, enterprises need technical assistance
from the EU’s experts or the government’s competent authorities. Besides these common
views, participants of each affected industry express opinions regarding the impacts of BCAs
on their industries and develop their corresponding action plans.
IISD.org
19
Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanisms and Impacts on Vietnam
3.2.1 Iron and Steel
SHD participants from the VSA noted that Vietnam’s current annual steel export output could
reach about 9 million–10 million tonnes, of which approximately 20% is exported to the EU
market. This industry has a huge initial investment and operating costs. At the same time,
participants affirmed that businesses in the Vietnamese steel industry face many difficulties
when responding to the BCA requirements.
Vietnam steelmaking technology, mainly blast furnaces, is a high-emission technology (about
three times more than electric furnaces) but is suitable for large production volumes, as well
as the specific conditions and circumstances of Vietnam. In addition, although information
relating to BCAs has been disseminated through different channels, many difficulties
remain in raising awareness among enterprises. Consequently, only a small number of steel
industry enterprises understand the technical aspects of BCAs/the CBAM. Despite that, VSA
businesses have gradually become accustomed to inventorying GHG emissions, as required
by the government via recently issued legal documents. Some businesses have also reported
GHG emissions according to the EU’s CBAM roadmap.
A steel industry representative also indicated that if businesses in the industry have to pay a
carbon tax, they should prioritize paying that tax to Vietnam rather than paying it to foreign
countries. Therefore, steel enterprises recommend that the government issue regulations on
the domestic carbon market soon to limit the impact of foreign BCA mechanisms.
3.2.2 Aluminum
Participants from the Vietnam Aluminum Association (VAA) noted that the aluminum
production process has six stages, five of which can be performed by Vietnam’s aluminum
industry: i) bauxite exploitation; ii) alumina production; iv) aluminum alloy smelting; v)
casting, extrusion, pressing, and rolling; and vi) product surface treatment. The third stage,
aluminum smelting, cannot be done domestically. As a result, enterprises in the aluminum
industry remain entirely dependent on imported aluminum ingots and billets for their
production of aluminum products (Vietnam Aluminum Profile Association, n.d.). Hence,
if raw aluminum is imported for export to the EU, the source of the imports must have low
carbon emissions to meet the requirements for export activities.
Representatives of Vietnamese aluminum enterprises also noted that the main emission
sources in the production process of aluminum products in Vietnam are energy used and
emissions released during industrial production. Some businesses in the aluminum industry
have made efforts to implement solutions to increase energy efficiency (improve the efficiency
of electrical equipment; reduce furnace heat loss during alloying, casting, extrusion, etc.;
pressing and rolling aluminum) and add additives (activated carbon) to reduce losses
during the aluminum smelting process. In addition, some businesses have also implemented
environmental, social, and governance principles and aim to participate in afforestation
projects to generate carbon credits for themselves.

the most developed market in the next 5 years due to increasing consumption from China, IISD.org
20
Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanisms and Impacts on Vietnam
India, and Japan, Vietnam’s aluminum industry is predicted to have a good growth rate,
averaging 7%/year. By these participants’ estimations, the EU’s CBAM is expected to reduce
Vietnamese exports to the EU by about 4%, equivalent to about USD 12 million per year.
3.2.3 Cement
The export growth rate of Vietnamese cement reached 171% per year in 2022, indicating
that this sector has a lot of potential (Hòa Phát Group, 2022). However, the cement
manufacturing industry is composed of very few large enterprises; most businesses are of
medium and small scale. This poses challenges in the implementation and enforcement of the
CBAM for the sector in general. Large companies typically have sufficient financial resources
to pay for consulting services from legal departments and to hire legal staff to closely monitor
BCA regulations. However, for medium and small enterprises, it is difficult to meet this
requirement. They often struggle to balance profits with the recruitment of legal staff.
Following the agreement to reduce fossil fuel consumption at the recent United Nations
Climate Change Conference 2023 (COP 28), the Vietnam Cement Association has begun
initial responses to mitigate the impact of the EU’s CBAM on the industry. However, most
cement plants in Vietnam have not yet made official declarations about their carbon emissions.
Participants from cement enterprises noted that emission inventories have been initiated for
plants exporting to the United States and Australia, but no specific actions have been taken for
the EU market. Some major cement plants in Vietnam, such as Vissai, Long Sơn, and Xuân
Thành, have conducted emission reports and inventories, hired consultants, and organized
training on emission reporting. Even though larger enterprises are willing to pay for legal
consulting services and build a legal team, most small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
do not prioritize these aspects; hence, it remains very challenging for them to comply with
CBAM requirements.
In addition, cement production is currently declining due to high input costs and low selling
prices. This issue is particularly critical for SME plants without a stable customer base, which
face the risk of closure. Consequently, the disparity between production costs and selling
prices leads to diminishing resources, which poses significant challenges to meeting new
regulations and maintaining sustainable business operations for most cement enterprises. In
this context, the Vietnam Cement Association and the industry’s enterprises have been striving
to develop specific strategies and measures to not only minimize the impact of the CBAM
but also enhance competitiveness in the international market. This includes investing in green
technology, improving production efficiency, and building a stable customer base to sustain
the growth and sustainable development of Vietnam’s cement industry.
3.2.4 Fertilizer
Based on the industry strategy for fertilizer and Vietnam’s National Strategy on Climate
Change to 2050, all businesses in the chemical and fertilizer production sector are expected
to apply technologies to reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions by 2030. The potential is to
reduce CO2 emissions by 5.6 million tonnes from 2021 to 2030. Carbon capture technologies IISD.org
21
Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanisms and Impacts on Vietnam
are expected to be implemented from 2045, covering approximately 50% of production levels,
equivalent to a reduction of about 4 million tonnes of carbon annually.
As previously mentioned, Vietnam produces and exports fertilizers but has not yet exported
CBAM-covered products (inorganic fertilizers) to Europe. Currently, 16 facilities in the sector
are required to conduct audits and mandatory reductions of N2O emissions, as stipulated
under Decision 01/2022/QD-TTG,6 while Vietnam’s fertilizer industry aims to prioritize
domestic production and supply over exports. For the time being, therefore, efforts to reduce
N2O emissions in the sector would most likely focus on domestic emission reduction targets
rather than addressing CBAM impacts (Trung tâm WTO, 2023d).
Mr. Phùng Hà, Vice President of the Vietnam Fertilizer Association, emphasized an urgent
need for a new production strategy for the fertilizer industry in Vietnam (Nhật Xuân et al.,
2023). The exothermic chemical reactions involved in fertilizer production are considered
direct emissions because these reactions result in the generation of CO2. On the one
hand, reducing ammonia in fertilizer production processes becomes crucial to mitigate
environmental impacts. However, implementing such reductions comes at a considerable cost.
On the other hand, exploring carbon credit trading to minimize carbon emissions in fertilizer
production does not appear to be highly feasible at present, given the current high prices in
the carbon credit market. Therefore, fertilizer companies that aim to enter the international
market need to quickly adapt and implement new production plans and strategies. In addition,
Mr. Phùng Hà stressed that government regulatory agencies need to proactively develop and
issue supportive policies and guidelines for businesses (Nhật Xuân et al., 2023). These policies
should encourage and provide financial support, technology, and human resource training to
help businesses transition their business models appropriately. This not only aims to enhance
the competitiveness of Vietnamese fertilizer companies on the international stage but also to
help them better adapt to the stringent changes and requirements of the global market.
3.2.5 Labour Unions
Environmental measures and policies can bring significant long-term benefits to workers by
improving the working environment and creating greener job opportunities. However, in the
short term, these measures often negatively impact workers. For example, the implementation
of regulations on supply chain traceability, as seen in the case of Germany and other European
countries, can lead to reduced orders for Vietnamese businesses, resulting in job losses and
affecting the income and social welfare of workers. This highlights the interconnectedness
between employers and employees, where difficulties faced by one side inevitably affect the
other. Participants from the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor noted that they have
been actively implementing government directives and rolling out the National Green Growth
Strategy to foster a greener working environment and develop communication strategies for
all levels of trade unions. This strategy aims to help workers better understand the concept of
green living and the value of energy efficiency in both production and daily life. This not only

establishments subject to greenhouse gas inventory. There are 21 sectors and 1912 entities subject to the GHG
inventory and the preparation of GHG reduction plans following the roadmap.
IISD.org
22
Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanisms and Impacts on Vietnam
contributes to building a greener working and living environment but also supports businesses
in adapting to climate change and environmental policies.
3.2.6 Financial Sector
Different SHD participants have expressed their opinions regarding the role of the financial
sector. At first, participants from the government observed that there are different approaches
to building policy frameworks. From the business perspective, there are six factors to consider:
finance, market, technology, human resources, information, and resource management.
Businesses have two financial sources: public (state and government funds) and private (the
businesses themselves). From the state’s perspective, the issue of finance involves revenue and
expenditure. There is a circular flow: any revenues collected could be reinvested to support
technological factors and innovative projects, thereby providing support back to businesses—
for example, those affected by the CBAM. Clearly, the perspectives of these two entities
regarding CBAM-related issues differ. While the state is concerned with managing financial
revenue and expenditure, businesses need to consider five other factors in addition to finance.
Therefore, it is necessary to find a common ground between businesses and the state, with
academic institutions acting as the main bridge.
From another angle, participants from the industry highlighted that when investing in
Vietnam, businesses often question the costs of complying with CBAM and whether these
costs would lead to increased sales or enhanced business value. It was emphasized that a
fundamental concern for businesses is managing costs, suggesting that they should find
alternative ways to balance expenses. Investment funds, government investment funds, or
other sources of support could assist businesses in this regard. The participant also raised the
issue of whether the costs of complying with the CBAM or BCAs are appropriate and whether
businesses should mobilize resources from outside the company, assessing the effectiveness
of such mobilization. These questions are frequently encountered when advising Vietnamese
businesses, especially those exporting in sectors like aluminum and steel. Additionally,
businesses often inquire about access to green financial resources when complying with
the CBAM. They wonder if they should participate in alliances like the Green Finance
Subcommittee established by the European Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam. There is
also the question of whether Vietnamese businesses should proactively seek funding for their
incurred costs or establish investment funds to research CBAM compliance. Concerns about
whether Vietnam is lagging in CBAM compliance compared to proactive countries like
Thailand and Indonesia were also noted, suggesting that Vietnam should be more proactive.
Finally, there is a discussion on whether industry associations, such as those for aluminum and
steel, should work more collaboratively rather than separately, as they currently do in Vietnam.
In practice, the role of finance in decarbonization cannot be denied. Finance plays a crucial
role in production transformation to reduce CO2 and other GHG emissions. First, finance can
support investment in green technologies and projects, such as renewable energy and public
transportation, facilitating the transition to more sustainable production and consumption
systems. Second, finance can contribute to the development of green financial markets by
creating products and services that support projects and businesses with positive impacts on
the environment. Third, finance can help allocate capital efficiently to projects with positive IISD.org
23
Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanisms and Impacts on Vietnam
environmental impacts, such as reducing emissions and enhancing energy efficiency. Finally,
finance also plays a significant role in managing environmental risks by ensuring compliance
with environmental and social standards in investment and financial activities. This highlights
the importance of integrating environmental factors into financial decision making to promote
sustainable development and minimize negative environmental impacts.
Recently, United Overseas Bank (UOB) Vietnam has forged a green trade finance partnership
with Betrimex, a Ben Tre Import-Export Joint Stock Company (Tuổi trẻ News, 2024). Under
this agreement, UOB will extend short-term credit facilities to Betrimex for importing or
sourcing domestic raw materials to produce certified organic products, including those with
Fairtrade certification. This certification underscores Betrimex’s adherence to stringent
standards encompassing social responsibility, environmental sustainability, and economic
viability, such as ensuring safe working conditions, environmental protection, sustainable
livelihoods, and community development. This initiative is seen as aligning with UOB
Vietnam’s commitment to financing sustainable ventures, thereby contributing to steering the
economy toward a greener and more sustainable trajectory (Tuổi trẻ News, 2024).
In a parallel endeavour, Orient Commercial Bank (OCB) inked an agreement with the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) to undergo a green banking transformation that
aims to foster sustainable development. Initially, the IFC will allocate approximately USD
150 million to OCB to lend to enterprises meeting green credit criteria at preferential interest
rates (Thanh Van, 2024). These funds will primarily target sectors such as renewable energy,
environmentally friendly high-tech industries, and sustainable agriculture. Such initiatives
highlighted the bank’s intention to introduce specialized financial products tailored to green
initiatives, including green bonds, green credits, and green payment platforms, thereby
confirming OCB’s commitment to adjusting products to minimize environmental impact,
with eventual plans to reject projects detrimental to the environment or with negative
social repercussions. Moreover, Asia Commercial Bank commenced in 2024 by unveiling
a green and social credit package totalling VND 2,000 billion. This package prioritizes
funding for businesses with green or socially oriented business plans, encompassing sectors
such as renewable energy (solar power), energy efficiency, green construction, and clean
transportation. Interest rates for both short- and long-term loans start from 6% per annum,
with waived or reduced prepayment fees (Thanh Van, 2024).
In addition, SHD participants noted that the BCA mechanism could play a crucial role in
incentivizing countries and businesses to engage in carbon-neutral activities. To facilitate the
field of financing for carbon neutrality, this mechanism needs to be designed with factors
such as clear and transparent standards for measuring emissions, flexible payment methods
to reduce financial barriers, encouragement to invest in green projects like renewable energy,
support for developing countries to effectively participate in carbon-neutral activities, and
international cooperation to enhance the effectiveness of these activities and promote the
transition to a greener and more sustainable economy.

3.4 From Academia
University academics play a pivotal role in addressing the challenges posed by BCA policies
in general and the CBAM in particular. They can respond effectively through a multifaceted
approach encompassing research, consultancy, support, and active engagement with both
governmental bodies and industries.
First, academics can contribute significantly through rigorous research efforts. This research
involves conducting comprehensive studies on the potential impacts of the CBAM/BCAs
across various sectors, such as iron and steel, cement, aluminum, fertilizer, etc. Through
cost-benefit analyses, academics can evaluate the economic implications of these policies,
identifying potential winners and losers. Furthermore, academics can delve into developing
innovative solutions tailored to each sector’s needs and challenges. These solutions can range
from technological advancements to policy recommendations aimed at mitigating adverse
effects and maximizing benefits. Recommendations should encompass short-, medium-, and
long-term strategies, addressing both immediate concerns and future sustainability goals.
Second, academics possess the expertise and objectivity necessary to provide consultancy
services to governmental agencies and industries regarding the implementation of BCA
measures. They can undertake this role by offering regular assessments and progress reports
on the execution of these policies. Through these reports, academics can evaluate the efficacy
of current measures, pinpoint any deficiencies, and propose strategic recommendations
to optimize outcomes. By assuming the role of impartial advisors, academics foster well-
informed decision-making processes and enable policy adjustments that align with the
evolving landscape. This consultancy role underscores academia’s crucial function in guiding
stakeholders toward more effective and sustainable approaches to managing carbon emissions
and trade policies.
Third, academics are well-positioned to provide tangible assistance to industries grappling
with the implications of BCAs, specifically the CBAM. At first, it is about raising awareness
of enterprises affected by the CBAM. As noted by one industry participant in the SHDs,
surveys of business reactions to the CBAM in ASEAN conducted by organizations like PwC
or the ASEAN Development Economic Research Institute (results up to February 2024)
classify businesses into four groups: those completely unaware of the CBAM, those aware
but unsure of its impact, those who understand the impact on six industries but do not
know how to respond, and those who fully understand CBAM and are developing response
strategies (Buysing Damsté et al., 2024). Scholars could assist enterprises in any or all of these
categories, from raising awareness about the CBAM and its impacts on different sectors to
developing strategies to respond effectively to the CBAM.
Particularly, an academic expert could help calculate and balance the costs of implementing
BCAs against the profits of businesses to maximize their profitability. In practice, when
allocating resources to meet CBAM requirements, including investments in technology,
infrastructure upgrades, and administrative costs related to carbon accounting and reporting,
businesses may wonder whether compliance with CBAM regulations leads to increased
sales volumes or enhances the overall value proposition of the company. These questions
underscore the fundamental challenge that businesses face: balancing the costs of compliance IISD.org
25
Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanisms and Impacts on Vietnam
against potential benefits and market competitiveness. These are areas where scholars can
act as facilitators. By offering specialized knowledge in carbon accounting methodologies,
academics can guide industries in accurately measuring and monitoring their emissions.
This collaborative effort not only ensures compliance with regulatory standards but also
facilitates the implementation of targeted emission reduction strategies. Through this hands-
on support, industries gain the necessary tools and insights to navigate the complexities of
carbon management effectively. In essence, academia’s role in assisting industries underscores
its practical contributions to fostering sustainability and regulatory compliance within the
business landscape.
Fourth, university faculty members play a central role in bridging the gap between
government agencies and affected industries. They can facilitate knowledge exchange
and collaboration through various platforms such as international conferences, seminars,
workshops, on-the-job training programs, and fieldwork initiatives. These platforms provide
opportunities for stakeholders to share insights, best practices, and lessons learned, fostering
a collaborative approach to addressing CBAM/BCA challenges. Academic publications also
serve as a crucial channel for disseminating research findings and policy recommendations.
Through published articles, policy briefs, and regular reports, academics can reach a wider
audience, including policy-makers, industry leaders, and fellow researchers. These publications
not only contribute to the academic discourse but also inform real-world decision-making
processes, driving evidence-based policy formulation and implementation. IISD.org

4.0 International Principles and Best
Practices
According to Vietnamese stakeholders, some of the issues that are important to consider when
discussing the design of BCAs and international principles and best practices include (i)
the principle of common but differentiated responsibility, (ii) the extent of carbon footprint
traceability and measurement, (iii) the extent of coverage of BCA/CBAM measures, (iv)
administrative burden, (v) technical assistance and technology transfer, and (vi) international
dialogues and cooperation platforms to coordinate the design of BCAs.
4.1 The Principle of Common but Differentiated
Responsibility
The Paris Agreement includes the phrase “common but differentiated responsibilities,” in
Article 2, Clause 2, where it explains: “the Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity
and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities,
in light of different national circumstances” (United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change, 2015). Specifically, the agreement acknowledges that countries have
different economic, social, and developmental conditions, and therefore, they will have
different responsibilities and capabilities in addressing climate change. This agreement creates
a flexible legal framework that allows each country to define and implement its commitments
based on its own capabilities and circumstances while still aiming toward the common goal
of mitigating climate change globally. The current contentious issue is whether the CBAM
creates differential treatment between developed and developing nations. To ensure fairness
in the implementation of CBAMs, it is necessary to consider and differentiate the levels of
emissions of each country. Although shared responsibility is something that every country
needs to fulfill, not all nations should have equivalent responsibilities. Advanced nations in
industrial sectors need to clearly define their responsibilities in a way that aligns with reality
(Pleeck & Mitchell, 2023). For instance, Figure 4, outlining cumulative CO2 emissions over
the period 1751–2017, shows that the United States was accountable for 25% of the total
carbon emissions in the atmosphere, while the EU was responsible for approximately 22%.
The emissions from poorer countries in the Global South were minimal. Even then, China’s
per capita emissions are significantly lower than those of both the United
States and the EU. IISD.org
27
Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanisms and Impacts on Vietnam
Figure 4. Who has contributed most to global CO2 emissions?
Source: Ritchie, 2019.
In fact, the EU has made significant progress in addressing climate change by introducing its
CBAM. Currently, China is the largest contributor to global CO2 emissions, accounting for
approximately 30%, followed by the United States with contributions of up to 14% (Lee et
al., 2023). Despite that, Vietnamese stakeholders believe that the EU’s CBAM has somehow
overlooked the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities and respective
capabilities” concerning developing nations in its design. This oversight could be challenging,
given that the EU’s current per capita emissions exceed 5 tonnes, compared to only 0.3 tonnes
and 1.5 tonnes in low-income and lower-middle-income countries, respectively (Lee et al.,
2023). The CBAM requires countries with very different technology levels to face the same
carbon requirements and duties. The more outdated the technology, the lower the output
and often the higher the emissions, perpetuating historical inequalities (Sen, n.d.). Since the
revenue generated from CBAM tariffs is unlikely to be reimbursed to developing countries,
the EU should then provide substantial and explicit technical assistance/aid to countries that
are poorer and responsible for less carbon emissions.
Climate change must be addressed cooperatively as a global public good involving all
stakeholders. Making various parties cooperate is not an easy task. Given that a stable climate
is a public good, one country could emit more but still bear the same responsibility as a
country that emits less. In the design of BCA/CBAM, the applying countries should consider
the principle of common but differentiated responsibility so that exporters from developing
countries or least developed countries (LDCs) could be given, for instance, special and
differential treatment compared to those of more developed nations. This will help create a
fairer, more effective framework for reducing global carbon emissions.

4.2 The Extent of Carbon Footprint Traceability and
Measurement
Vietnam faces difficulties in inventorying carbon emissions amid the urgent need to calculate
these emissions. Accurate calculations can lead to proper measures in implementing carbon
border mechanisms by determining the percentage of emissions attributable to the exporting
country. “The carbon footprint is a measure of the amount of greenhouse gases (such as CO2,
CH4, N2O),” both direct and indirect emissions, released into the environment by human
activity or accumulated throughout the life cycle stages of a product (VR Energy, 2024).
Internationally, the ability of the carbon footprint to address issues such as carbon leakage,
competitiveness concerns, border tax adjustments, and the distribution of emissions among
countries is receiving increasing attention from the media and policy-makers. However,
tracking the sources of carbon poses certain challenges, as specifically illustrated in Figure 5.
Figure 5. Carbon traceability
Source: Trung tâm WTO, 2023c.
As noted by an expert from the Technical Assistance Project on the CBAM impact
assessment, Vietnamese enterprises can only provide emissions information during the
production and processing of goods. In contrast, the CBAM requires emissions data for
input/raw materials at some stages used in production. According to the EU’s proposal, the
calculation of goods emissions will prioritize actual emissions measured by the enterprises
themselves. In cases where enterprises cannot fully determine or have indirect emissions,
the CBAM will use default average emission values for each exporting country issued by the
European Commission based on information provided by the exporting country or group
of exporting countries. If a country does not have default values, the emissions will be based
on the highest emission levels in the EU for each type of product (Vietnam Financial Times,
2023). In some cases, the last exporters face difficulties soliciting information from previous
exporters exporting raw materials for them. They may have emission value at their stage of
production, but not in the previous stages. As such, BCA/CBAM should somehow specify the
burden for exporters of different stages so that, for instance, the last exporters could share the
responsibilities with others exporting input/raw materials used in production.
4.3 The Extent of Coverage of BCA/CBAM Measures
It is suggested that the EU’s CBAM needs to be designed to
prevent double payment of relevant carbon costs. In case enterprises in exporting countries
already bear some costs for climate change mitigation and/or for environmental purposes
(even if they have not paid any carbon price), should BCA’s applying countries not consider

reducing part(s) of the cost to be paid in importing countries regarding carbon content?
This would ensure fair competition between domestic and imported products while
encouraging exporting countries to continue implementing measures to reduce carbon
emissions. Additionally, it facilitates businesses in transitioning to cleaner, more sustainable
production and consumption, thereby promoting economic and environmental development
on a global scale.
4.4 Administrative Burden
During the transitional phase, EU importers of covered goods must submit quarterly CBAM
reports detailing the quantities of covered products imported, the actual embedded GHG
emissions associated with these products, and any carbon prices paid in the country of
origin (not including export price reductions or other forms of compensation upon export).
In essence, exporters have to provide such information for the EU importers to submit to
the authority, and thus, exporters also bear the administrative burden. This burden of the
reporting process may include ensuring accuracy, completeness, and compliance with legal
requirements, as well as managing deadlines and coordinating with other stakeholders. It may
include synthesizing data on carbon emissions, energy usage, or other relevant indicators and
presenting them in standardized formats for verification and analysis. However, reporting
carbon emissions from the exporter’s perspective raises uncertainty, as the report could be
rejected or returned because it does not meet the quality standards required by the importing
country. Additionally, if an enterprise exports the same product to multiple countries, a
common template/standard for reporting carbon emissions would ease the burden for
exporters by avoiding multiple reporting processes to importing countries with different
criteria. The administrative process should also be gradually streamlined and improved to
further reduce the difficulties in reporting. It will also be useful to consider providing technical
assistance to enterprises, particularly micro and SMEs, in developing countries and LDCs to
build their capacity to report accurately and in a timely manner.
4.5 Technical Assistance and Technology Transfer
Technology transfer between countries and territories is essential, and developed countries
are encouraged to transfer their technologies to developing countries and LDCs in an effort
to address climate change and reduce carbon emissions. As noted by industry participants
in the SHDs, technologies that have been phased out in one country could be transferred
to another country at a lower level of development if the application of such technologies
produces less emission than the old ones. Through providing support and transferring
sustainable technologies, countries can accelerate the transition to low-carbon economies and
enhance their resilience to climate-related challenges. For example, advanced energy efficiency
technologies can decrease emissions from industrial and construction processes, while
renewable energy systems can substitute fossil fuel-based energy sources. Similarly, climate-
smart agricultural methods can enhance carbon sequestration in soils and decrease emissions
from deforestation and land-use changes. By utilizing these technologies with support from
technical assistance programs, countries can achieve significant reductions in carbon emissions
while promoting economic development and sustainable growth.

4.6 International Dialogues and Cooperation Platforms to
Facilitate Convergence in BCA Design
It is suggested that international dialogues and cooperation platforms should be established
to facilitate convergence in the design of BCAs. Achieving convergence on the scope,
pricing mechanisms, and enforcement methods of the BCA mechanism remains crucial for
promoting positive trade development. This ensures that exporters do not have to comply
with too many different BCA rules when exporting to different markets; also, BCA-applying
countries can deliberate and make decisions thoughtfully and fairly, based on contributions
and input from relevant stakeholders. By organizing events, workshops, and forums/meetings,
participation from relevant parties could have an open space for discussion and negotiation.
This participation effectively serves as a foundation for fostering convergence and cooperation
among parties to design and implement BCAs effectively and fairly, ensuring that relevant
policies and measures are promoted in a unified and efficient manner. IISD.org
31
Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanisms and Impacts on Vietnam
5.0 The Way Forward
Businesses need access to as much information as possible. The purpose of implementing
the CBAM is not to collect money but to signal that the green transition is inevitable. From
a business perspective, companies need to pay attention to developing strategies in the short,
medium, or long term. In the short term, businesses need to carefully consider the actual costs
of complying with CBAM. Also, businesses should consider the global supply chain, especially
the commitments of existing free trade agreements, to leverage green financial resources and
prepare CBAM reports—even if they are not directly exporting to the EU, they could still be
part of the global supply chain. It is essential for businesses to proactively seek information on
policies related to CBAM through EU-CBAM webinars.
In the medium and long terms, businesses need to prepare strong financial resources for
the general trend toward the green transition and the establishment of an emissions trading
market. Regardless of which aspect they focus on, the key concern remains the budget
for the green transition. Technological advancements, operational costs, and other arising
expenses are also significant areas requiring substantial investment. Two recommendations
emerge from these realities. For one, businesses can create a pool of financial resources by
themselves. As noted by one industry participant in the SHDs, Thailand’s experience can be
instructional: driven by the needs of the Thai business community, businesses have pooled
resources and established research funds to comply with the CBAM, proactively engaging
major markets like the EU and the United States. Another feasible solution is a collaboration
between private investment funds and government investment funds to create green financial
funds that support businesses. In addition to financial resources, Vietnamese businesses must
proactively gather information and establish networks for CBAM compliance research. By
sharing and leveraging information, businesses can develop effective strategies to not only
meet international market demands but also achieve sustainable long-term growth. This not
only helps businesses meet global standards but also creates opportunities for them to expand
and grow their markets.
From a governmental perspective, Vietnam holds a certain position in negotiating with other
countries, and thus, various options need to be carefully considered. During BCA/CBAM-
related discussions, cooperation, or negotiations, Vietnam can request contributions and
support for technical aspects related to BCA/CBAM from countries already implementing
such BCAs. In addition, the government can harness feedback and insights from companies,
academic institutions, and research institutes to enhance and refine its policies and strategies.
This approach not only aids in negotiation processes but also ensures the development
of rational, well-informed policies that promote sustainable development and align with
international standards. IISD.org

Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanisms and Impacts on Vietnam
6.0 Conclusion
The initiation of the CBAM has ignited substantial discourse, owing to its perceived disparate
treatment of developing and developed nations. This debate stems from the significant carbon
emissions emanating from developing countries like India, China, and Vietnam. Presently,
CBAM is in its initial stage, primarily concentrating on gathering reporting data from
importers, with several key pieces of implementing legislation still to be written. Nonetheless,
there is evident enthusiasm among relevant stakeholders in Vietnam to promote sustainability
across various pivotal sectors. This report has offered insights into multi-stakeholder responses
to this mechanism and suggested ways in which the challenge of BCAs can be better faced to
ensure effective climate action in an equitable manner among countries at different levels of
development.
Furthermore, the report elucidates various international policies and measures concerning
CBAMs. It suggests that formulating a comprehensive national policy framework to deal with
CBAMs and other similar schemes by trading partners will take considerable time due to its
distinctive characteristics and stringent requirements. Achieving optimal efficacy will require
collaborative efforts among businesses, regulatory bodies, and governments facilitated by
educational institutions equipped with high-calibre research personnel.
