How does CBAM Impact Southeast Asian
Economies?
The European Commission adopted in August 2023 detailed reporting rules for its newly
created Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). CBAM is a mechanism that aims
to incentivize exporting countries to decarbonize their industries. However, for Southeast
Asia's economies, collectively khown as ASEAN, which rely heavily on the EU export
market, CBAM presents a potential double-edged sword. While it could spur much-needed
environmental progress, it might also lead to economic losses if ASEAN nations are not
prepared for the transition. This article will delve into the mechanics of CBAM, its current
implementation status in ASEAN countries, and broader implications it will have on Asia.
Learn how CBAM can shape the current trade dynamics and incentivize further
sustainable development in Southeast Asia.
What is CBAM?
CARBON BORDER ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM
Price mechanism on carbon intensive goods entering the EU
From 2026
2023- 2026
DEFINITIVE REGIME
TRANSITIONAL PHASE
s EU importers under CBAM are required to
register with national authorities to purchase
CBAM certificates priced based on the weekly
average EU ETS auction price in €/tonne of CO2
emitted.
s Importers declare embedded emissions and
surrender certificates annually.
s lf importers can prove a carbon price has been
paid during production, deductions apply.
Serves as a trial and learning phase for stakeholders
(importers, producers, authorities).
s Targets carbon-intensive imports like cement, iron,
steeL aluminum, fertilizers, electricity, and hydrogen.
* Importers must report embedded greenhouse gas
emissions vwithout certificate purchase Oor
surrender.
s Reporting rules are flexible; by 2025, only the EU
method is accepted, with estimates limited to
complex goods.

The EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is a “mechanism that puts a fair
price on the carbon emitted during the production of carbon-intensive goods that are
entering the EU, and to encourage cleaner industrial production in non-EU countries”
(European Commission). CBAM essentially puts a price on the carbon emissions embodied
in certain goods imported into the EU. This incentivizes cleaner production methods
outside the EU and ensures imported goods compete on a level playing field with those
produced within the bloc. From October 2023, CBAM entered its transitional phase. The
carbon-intensive goods that fall under this period of CBAM include: cement, iron and
steel, aluminum, fertilizers, electricity and hydrogen. During this period, importers of
specific carbon-intensive goods are required to report the direct and indirect greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions associated with their imports. This reporting requirement serves as a
learning period for all parties involved (importers, producers, and authorities) and allows
for the collection of valuable data on embedded emissions. This data will be crucial for
refining the methodology used in the definitive CBAM phase. A review of the CBAM's
functioning during its transitional phase will be concluded before the entry into force of
the definitive system in 2026.
Impacts of CBAM in ASEAN Countries
Strong trade ties between ASEAN and the EU mean the CBAM will have a noticeable
influence, although the severity will differ across the region. This is because some
countries rely more heavily on exports with high carbon footprints. Indonesia, Malaysia,
Thailand, and Vietnam are likely to be most affected due to their significant exports in
sectors covered by CBAM. Conversely, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Singapore are
expected to see minimal impacts as their primary exports currently fall outside the
CBAM's scope. Here's a look at how some ASEAN member states could be affected:
Vietnam
The European Union (EU) is a vital market for Vietnam, ranking as its 3rd largest export
destination in 2022 encompassing a significant 14.4% of total Vietnamese exports. CBAM
regulation applies to 5% of Vietnamese exports to the EU and particularly affects the iron
& steel sector the most (Trading Economics, 2022). Estimates suggest that CBAM could
result in Vietnamese exporters from these sectors losing around USD $830 million
annually, translating to roughly 0.6% of the country's GDP (New Climate Institute, 2023).
In anticipation of the CBAM transition period, the Vietnamese government took swift
action. In November 2023, they issued an official directive outlining procedures for
measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This was followed by training programs
designed to equip businesses with the knowledge and tools needed to comply with GHG
regulations. These measures aim to minimize carbon footprints across the supply chain,
with mandatory implementation set for 2025.
Indonesia
The European Union (EU) remains a significant export destination for Indonesia, ranking
as the 5th largest covering approximately 7.4% of Indonesian exports. Among these
exports to the EU, approximately 6.2% are subjected to CBAM, where the most impacted
sectors are iron & steel and fertilizers (Trading Economics, 2022). New Climate Institute
estimates CBAM could lead to a modest decline in annual GDP, around 0.1% or $500
million. Indonesia views CBAM as a catalyst for adaptation and a chance to prepare for
future climate-driven trade measures. The Indonesian government is finalizing carbon tax
regulations to incentivize businesses in lowering emissions. This will allow Indonesian
companies to choose between purchasing carbon credits on the IDXCarbon exchange or
paying the carbon tax, directly contributing to emissions reduction.
Thailand
The European Union (EU) is Thailand's 4th largest export destination, receiving around
10% of Thailand's total export in 2022. Among the total exports to the EU, approximately
1.49% of the exports will be subjected to CBAM (Work Point Today, 2023), with iron & steel
being the most vulnerable industry. The implementation of CBAM could result in
potential annual revenue losses for Thailand of around USD $500 million, representing a
modest 0.2% reduction of its GDP. In response to CBAM, Thailand has launched the BCG
(bio, circular and green) economic development plan. This initiative aims to incentivize
manufacturers to adopt environmentally friendly technologies that enhance product
value while minimizing environmental footprint.

The European Union (EU) is a significant and growing trade partner for Malaysia,
accounting for 7.9% of its total trade and ranking as its 4th largest export destination in
2022. This market holds even greater potential, with Malaysian exports to the EU surging
by an impressive 21.8% in recent years. Currently, an estimated 6.7% of Malaysia"s
exports to the EU fall under CBAM, with the iron and steel sector being the most affected
(Bank Negara Malaysia, 2022). Furthermore, it is estimated that by 2026 (midf Research,
2023), if domestic manufacturers fail to comply with new CBAM standards, up to 57% of
Malaysia's exports to the EU could be impacted In response to this potential hurdle,
Malaysia has taken proactive steps:
s Mandatory Reporting: Starting October 2023, Malaysian exporters will be required
to report greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
s Government Support: Initiatives are underway to introduce carbon pricing and
support emission reduction efforts. These measures aim to assist exporters in
meeting CBAM requirements.
s National Framework: The government is establishing pre-conditions for a national
carbon accounting framework.
The Domino Effect
CBAM's impact on ASEAN exporters may be modest initially, as a small portion of their
exports fall under its current regulations. However, as CBAM expands and export volumes
rise, the financial burden could become significant. This poses a long-term threat to
ASEAN's competitiveness in the European market if its manufacturing sector remains
heavily reliant on carbon-intensive processes. Similar to China's opposition to the EU's
unilateral approach and its plans to expand its domestic carbon trading scheme, ASEAN
economies should be compelled to take similar actions, to encourage their exporting
businesses to decarbonize at a faster pace. This could involve ramping up energy
efficiency, accelerating emissions reductions, and potentially implementing domestic
carbon pricing mechanisms. While some ASEAN governments are already strengthening
their environmental regulations in response to CBAM, a more substantial and swifter
approach is necessary. To truly compete in the evolving global market, ASEAN will need to
significantly tighten its regulations and strive to reach a level closer to the EU's ambitious
environmental commitments. CBAM presents both challenges and opportunities. At
