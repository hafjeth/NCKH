NATIONAL STRATEGY TO BOOST VIETNAM’S TEXTILE AND GARMENT PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY | V
he Asian Productivity Organization (APO) was founded with a clear mission: to promote
productivity as the cornerstone of inclusive and sustainable growth across Asia and the Pacific.
For more than six decades, we have supported our member economies in building capabilities,
strengthening institutions, and developing forward-looking strategies to meet the demands of an
ever-changing global economy. At its heart, productivity is not merely about producing more with
less. It is about enabling societies to flourish, enterprises to remain competitive, and people to live
with dignity.
Vietnam’s textile and garment industry, a sector that provides livelihoods to millions and sustains
a vital share of national exports, exemplifies both the promise and the pressures of globalization.
This sector has been an engine of growth, yet it now stands at a crossroads. Rising labor costs, skill
mismatches, and heavy reliance on imported materials are challenging its competitiveness. At the
same time, sustainability imperatives and shifting buyer expectations are reshaping the industry,
demanding innovation, resilience, and transformation. Addressing these issues is essential if
Vietnam is to maintain its global position and unlock higher value from its textile economy.
This publication offers timely and practical insights into future pathways. It highlights the strategic
choices facing Vietnam as it navigates the twin imperatives of technological adoption and green
transition. The scenarios and recommendations presented herein underscore a truth that resonates
far beyond Vietnam’s borders: productivity growth in the 21st century will be defined not just by
efficiency, but by sustainability, adaptability, and the capacity to innovate. For the textile industry,
this means embracing Industry 4.0, investing in human capital, and embedding circular practices
into every stage of the value chain.
I invite policymakers, business leaders, researchers, and workers alike to reflect deeply on the
analyses in these pages. The journey ahead is complex, but it is also filled with opportunity. By
harnessing productivity as a driver of innovation and sustainability, Vietnam’s textile and garment
industry can move beyond being a supplier of low-cost labor toward becoming a global leader in
sustainable and high-value production. In doing so, it will contribute not only to Vietnam’s
economic aspirations but also to the broader vision of the APO: a more productive, sustainable, and
inclusive Asia and Pacific.

2. CURRENT STATE OF THE TEXTILE AND
GARMENT INDUSTRY IN VIETNAM
2.1 Overview
The textile and garment industry in Vietnam can be broadly decomposed into two main sectors: the
textile sector and the garment (or apparel) sector. The textile sector involves activities such as fiber
production (both natural and synthetic), spinning, weaving, knitting, and finishing fabrics, as well
as key subsectors like dyeing and printing, which add significant value through aesthetic and
functional enhancements. Meanwhile, the garment sector focuses on the design, cutting, and
stitching of fabrics to produce a wide range of apparel products. Subsector specialization, such as
in sportswear, fashion, or technical textiles, is essential for meeting the diverse and evolving needs
of both domestic and international markets.
Each subsector plays a critical role in the overall supply chain: the textile subsectors provide the
necessary raw materials, while the garment subsectors add creativity and functionality, transforming
fabrics into finished products. The future success of Vietnam’s textile and garment industry will
depend on the efficiency, innovation, and sustainability of these subsectors, with enhanced
integration between them being crucial for capturing greater value and competitiveness in the
global market.
The industry’s growth over the past decade has been remarkable. Between 2012 and 2022, textile
exports surged by 115%, while garment exports grew by 89%. The number of garment firms
increased by 217%, accompanied by a 169% rise in capital investment in the textile sector (GSO,
2023). Vietnam’s strategic location, competitive labor costs, and commitment to technology and
innovation have made it an attractive destination for global manufacturers and fashion brands. By
2022, Vietnam’s textile and garment exports reached USD44 billion, making the country one of the
world’s top exporters. Knitwear emerged as a key product category, accounting for 42.5% of total
garment and textile exports in Vietnam (GSO, 2023). Despite fluctuations in demand, particularly
a 9.6% dip in early 2023 (Statista, 2024), the sector remains a powerhouse, contributing more than
16% of Vietnam’s GDP and employing over 3 million people.
However, the industry’s export-heavy focus presents vulnerabilities. Dependence on markets such
as the USA and the EU exposes Vietnam to global demand fluctuations and shifting trade policies.
The industry’s dualistic structure, characterized by large export-oriented firms and smaller, locally
focused enterprises, presents additional challenges. Structural limitations like high upfront costs,
an uncertain return on investment (ROI), and workforce shortages further complicate growth.
Additionally, environmental sustainability remains a pressing concern. Vietnam has taken proactive
steps to address these issues, including Vietnam’s initiatives, such as the Sustainable Textile and
Apparel Program by the Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association (VITAS) and strategic guidelines
by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Development Strategy for the Textile, Garment, and
Leather Footwear Industry of Vietnam until 2030, Vision to 2035, which include ambitious goals
and measures to  promote resource efficiency and reduce environmental impacts. 4 | NATIONAL STRATEGY TO BOOST VIETNAM’S TEXTILE AND GARMENT PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY

Understanding these dynamics is critical to ensuring the future success of Vietnam’s textile and
garment industry. Subsequent sections will explore productivity trends, labor dynamics, capital
intensity, energy efficiency, and supply chain optimization. By examining each subsector,
policymakers and industry leaders can make informed decisions that drive sustainable development
and future growth.
2.2 Labor Trends
Labor is a crucial driver of Vietnam’s textile and garment industry, which employs millions of
workers, many of whom are women. In recent years, there has been a clear shift away from basic
cut-make-trim (CMT) toward higher value-added, technology-enabled products and processes
such as more complex knitwear, functional/technical textiles, eco-materials, and shorter,
personalized orders aligned with buyers’ sustainability and traceability requirements. However, the
industry still relies heavily on low-cost labor, particularly in rural areas. The availability of a large
workforce has traditionally been an advantage, but as labor costs gradually increase, there is a
growing need for improved labor productivity to maintain competitiveness.
2.2.1 Workforce Composition and Growth
Figure 1 provides a breakdown of the proportion of firms and labor within various subsectors of
Vietnam’s textile and garment industry. Notably, the manufacture of wearing apparel, except fur
apparel, dominates both categories significantly, comprising 65.6% of firms and employing 80.7%
of the labor force in the industry. This underscores the sector’s central role in Vietnam’s textile
economy, highlighting its extensive employment generation despite representing a relatively high
proportion of smaller firms. Conversely, subsectors such as spinning of textile fibers, finishing of
textiles, and the manufacture of made-up textile articles exhibit higher proportions of firms relative
to their labor contributions, suggesting potentially higher capital intensity or smaller scale of
operations compared to apparel manufacturing. This distribution underscores the diverse
composition of Vietnam’s textile and garment industry, where different subsectors play distinct
roles in terms of employment and economic contribution.

Relating to growth, the textile industry in Vietnam has witnessed diverse growth trajectories within
its key subsectors in the last 15 years.  In the textile subsector, weaving of textiles stands out with
an impressive average growth rate of 6.1% during the reviewed period. This growth has been
fueled by the rising domestic and global demand for woven fabrics, which continues to drive job
creation in the industry. Weaving has been a critical component of Vietnam’s textile value chain,
benefiting from the country’s cost-effective labor force and its integration into regional and global
supply networks.
Other key areas within the textile subsector, such as the spinning of textile fibers and finishing of
textiles, have demonstrated more moderate growth rates of 4.3% and 3.6%, respectively. These
subsectors contribute steadily to workforce expansion, ensuring a balanced distribution of
employment across the industry’s value chain. In addition, the production of knitted and crocheted
fabrics has maintained a solid growth pace of 5.0%, reflecting sustained market demand and
production efficiency, which continue to shape the labor dynamics within these subsectors.

The garment subsector, particularly the manufacturing of wearing apparel (except fur apparel), has
been a major driver of Vietnam’s industrial growth. The subsector’s labor force has grown at an
impressive 7.7% annually, highlighting Vietnam’s competitive advantage in garment manufacturing.
This growth is supported by favorable labor costs, a relatively skilled workforce, and efficient
production processes, positioning Vietnam as a leading exporter in global garment markets. Other
segments, such as articles of fur and knitted and crocheted apparel, have also shown significant
growth rates of 6.3% and 5.3%, respectively, reflecting the industry’s diversified capabilities.
2.2.2 Wages and Employment Conditions
The competitive advantage of Vietnam’s textile and garment industry is partly driven by its
relatively low labor costs. Average nominal monthly wages range from approximately USD215-
280 in Vietnam, placing it in the middle range compared to countries like Indonesia, Pakistan, and
Sri Lanka, where wages are lower, and Thailand, where wages are higher at around USD362 (ILO,
2021). When adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP), the wage gap between countries narrows,
though Vietnam remains an attractive option for cost-sensitive manufacturing. NATIONAL STRATEGY TO BOOST VIETNAM’S TEXTILE AND GARMENT PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY | 7

Despite these competitive wages, employment in the sector is characterized by a high proportion
of temporary contractual arrangements. While Vietnam has the lowest share of informal employment
among its peers, with only 25% of workers in the informal sector compared to 96% in Bangladesh
and 76% in Cambodia, temporary workers still face significant job insecurity and limited access to
social protection (ILO, 2021). Many workers are employed under casual contracts or as daily
laborers, making them vulnerable to labor market fluctuations and global demand changes,
particularly in the garment subsector.
2.2.3 Skill Development and Workforce Challenges
Figure 4 highlights the gender distribution and educational attainment among workers. It reveals
that a significant proportion of the workforce, particularly female workers, occupies lower-skilled
positions with limited educational qualifications, while consistently contributing a smaller
proportion of workers with higher education levels (university and above) in both the garment and
textile sectors.

With the new wave of digitalization and new requirements to go green in production, the industry
faces a pressing need to upskill its workforce, particularly in the textile subsector, where advanced
technical skills are required for operating and maintaining sophisticated machinery. One of the
core issues is the persistent mismatch between the skills provided by educational institutions and
the practical requirements of the industry. Many training programs are outdated, lacking focus on
modern technology, digital tools, and advanced machinery essential for the industry’s evolution.
As Vietnam climbs the global value chain, employers need workers proficient in handling
automation, data-driven production processes, and high-precision manufacturing tasks. However,
the current workforce often lacks these competencies, which constrains the industry’s ability to
innovate and grow, particularly in high-value areas like textile design, fabric engineering, and
sustainable production practices. Employers frequently cite difficulties in finding technically
skilled workers who can perform non-routine tasks required in more complex, innovation-driven
environments, exacerbating the skills gap.
In addition to these skill-based challenges, high employee turnover rates further impede workforce
development in the textile and garment sector (around 36% in 2020). Although the industry offers
employment to millions, low wages, job insecurity especially for those on temporary or informal
contracts and poor working conditions drive many workers to seek better opportunities. This
frequent turnover makes it costly for companies to train and retrain workers, limiting investment
in long-term skills development. Moreover, widespread misconceptions about the industry persist,
particularly among younger workers. Many perceive textile manufacturing as outdated, low-tech, NATIONAL STRATEGY TO BOOST VIETNAM’S TEXTILE AND GARMENT PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY | 9
CURRENT STATE OF THE TEXTILE AND GARMENT INDUSTRY IN VIETNAM
and physically demanding, dominated by repetitive tasks like cut, make, and trim (CMT) operations.
These outdated perceptions, combined with practical concerns such as poor occupational health
and safety standards ranging from high dust concentration and noise levels to inadequate lighting
and heat discourage potential workers from entering the industry. Beyond these misconceptions,
practical challenges also deter labor attraction. The sector continues to struggle with offering
competitive wages, particularly in higher value-added roles that go beyond basic manufacturing
tasks. Occupational health and safety concerns, including difficult working conditions with
excessive heat, humidity, and poor ventilation, also play a significant role in hampering labor
retention. These factors not only affect worker morale and productivity but also compound the
industry’s difficulty in attracting new talent, particularly as Vietnam seeks to shift toward more
advanced, sustainable, and technology-driven manufacturing practices.
Demographically, there has been a noticeable shift from younger to middle-aged workers within
the industry, indicating an aging workforce. The aging workforce in certain subsectors, particularly
in textile production, poses additional challenges. This demographic transition necessitates
strategic workforce planning initiatives focused on skills development, career advancement
opportunities, and ensuring sustainable labor practices amidst changing labor market dynamics.
2.2.4 Gender and Labor Mobility
The industry’s workforce is predominantly female, particularly in the garment subsector, where
women represent more than 70% of the labor force (VITAS, 2021). This gendered labor composition
has provided significant employment opportunities for women, but it has also raised issues related
to gender wage disparities and career advancement limitations. Addressing these gender inequities
will be vital for improving labor conditions and promoting more inclusive growth in the industry.
Gender disparity remains a persistent challenge within Vietnam’s textile and garment industry,
especially in terms of income inequality between female and male workers. Over the past decade,
wages have grown for both genders, but the growth rate has been consistently lower for women
compared to men. From 2010 to 2020, textile wages in Vietnam increased by 6.9% for males and
6.1% for females, while garment wages grew by 7.2% for males and 6.1% for females (ILO, 2021).
Although wage growth in Vietnam was higher than in countries like Pakistan and the Philippines,
it lagged behind Cambodia and Myanmar, where textile wages for males grew by 13.2% and 8.1%,
respectively, and for females by 10.1% and 8.7%. Despite this, Vietnam’s wage growth has been
relatively balanced between genders, reflecting consistent improvements in both sectors.
Although there has been improvement in the wage gap, with the ratio of female to male income
rising from 0.83 in 2012 to 0.90 in 2021, a significant gender disparity persists in the industry.
Women constitute a significant majority of the workforce, particularly in garment manufacturing,
where labor-intensive processes such as CMT are predominant. These roles tend to offer lower
wages and limited career advancement opportunities compared to more skilled positions, which
are often occupied by men. Female workers are over-represented among the sector’s low-wage
earners, with a high percentage earning less than two-thirds of the median income.

Furthermore, despite their critical role in the industry, many female garment, textile, and footwear
(GTF) employees face additional challenges due to the gendered nature of the workplace. The
sector is often described as being “female-dominated at the bottom and male-dominated at the top”
where women occupy the majority of low-skilled roles, while men hold higher-paying, managerial
positions (Vaughn et al., 2019).
In addition to wage disparities, educational attainment also highlights the unequal opportunities
faced by women in the textile and garment sectors. A significant proportion of the female workforce
occupies lower-skilled positions with limited educational qualifications, and they consistently
contribute a smaller proportion of workers with higher education levels (university and above).
This educational disparity further limits women’s opportunities for advancement into higher-
paying, skilled positions within the industry.
Labor mobility is another significant trend, with many workers migrating from rural to urban areas,
where the majority of textile and garment factories are located. Provinces such as Ho Chi Minh
City, Binh Duong, and Dong Nai are key manufacturing hubs, and internal migration has played a
crucial role in shaping the workforce dynamics in these regions. However, these workers often lack
access to formal education and training, perpetuating a cycle of low skills and limited mobility,
which pose major challenges for the industry.

Moreover, migrant female workers, who make up a large portion of the workforce in industrial
zones, face acute challenges. These migrant workers often experience difficulties accessing basic
social services, with 90% reporting problems in their destination provinces. Specifically, 71% of
migrant female workers lack access to public health services (Oxfam & CNCĐ Institute, 2021),
exacerbating their vulnerabilities.
2.3 Labor Productivity
Labor productivity in Vietnam’s garment and textile industry remains relatively low compared to
global benchmarks. While the country benefits from a young and sizable labor force, productivity
has been constrained by outdated technology and inefficient production practices. Recent efforts to
improve productivity have focused on modernizing equipment, improving worker training, and
streamlining production processes (Nguyen et al., 2021). However, despite these initiatives,
productivity growth remains uneven across the sector. Figure 6 provides a snapshot of the labor
productivity growth in Vietnam’s textile and garment industry.

Figure 7 highlights notable trends in labor productivity growth within Vietnam’s textile and
garment subsectors between 2009 and 2022. While there have been efforts to modernize equipment,
improve worker training, and streamline production, productivity growth is uneven across the
industry. Over this period, there is a clear distinction between the performance of different textile-
related industries and the garment sector, revealing divergent productivity trajectories.

The garment subsector has shown more promising growth in labor productivity. Wearing Apparel,
Except Fur Apparel, one of the most critical subsectors in Vietnam’s garment industry, experienced
an increase in productivity growth from 5.64% (2009–2015) to 7.37% (2016–2022). Notably, the
Knitted and Crocheted Apparel subsector witnessed a substantial rise in productivity, surging from
7.39% to 13.80% over the same periods. This encouraging growth can be attributed to the sector’s
increasing focus on automation, the adoption of modern technologies, and Vietnam’s growing
integration into global supply chains.
The shift toward more value-added production processes, such as higher-end apparel manufacturing,
has also contributed to the overall productivity gains in the garment subsector. However, continued
investment in workforce training, particularly in non-routine, technical tasks, will be necessary to
sustain this upward trajectory and further drive productivity growth.

CURRENT STATE OF THE TEXTILE AND GARMENT INDUSTRY IN VIETNAM
In contrast, labor productivity in the textile subsector has generally experienced a decline in growth
rate, particularly after 2015. For example, the Preparation and Spinning of Textile Fibers subsector
saw a sharp drop in productivity growth from 6.76% (2009–2015) to 3.21% (2016–2022). Similarly,
productivity growth in “Weaving of Textiles” decreased slightly from 6.87% to 6.48%, while
“Finishing of Textiles” dropped from 7.05% to 5.58%. These declines suggest that, despite
technological advances and increased demand, the productivity of the labor force in these subsectors
has not kept pace with the sector’s expansion.

Several factors, such as reliance on outdated machinery, a lack of skilled labor, and slow adaptation
to automation, may have contributed to this slowdown. These decreases may also reflect the
broader challenge of transitioning from labor-intensive, low-value-added production processes to
more capital-intensive, high-value-added activities in the textile subsector. This shift often requires
a longer adaptation period, as it involves significant investments in technology, infrastructure, and
workforce training before the full benefits can be realized. The slower productivity growth indicates
that many firms are still in the process of upgrading their operations to meet the demands of more
advanced production techniques.

CURRENT STATE OF THE TEXTILE AND GARMENT INDUSTRY IN VIETNAM
Figure 8 presents a comparative analysis of labor productivity and capital-labor ratios across
Vietnam’s textile and garment subsectors from 2009 to 2022, focusing on the top 3% of most
productive firms versus the rest. In the weaving of textiles sector, top firms increased their labor
productivity ratio from 7.4 times in 2009 to 16.0 times in 2022, with a corresponding rise in their
capital-labor ratio from 6.2 to 8.6 times. Similarly, in the manufacture of knitted and crocheted
fabrics, leading firms saw their labor productivity ratio soar from 5.0 to 43.3 times over the same
period, while their capital-labor ratio jumped from 4.8 to 23.9 times. These figures underscore a
widening gap between frontier firms and the industry average, indicating substantial disparities in
technological adoption and operational efficiency. While top firms continue to invest significantly
in modernization, the broader industry faces challenges in narrowing this gap, necessitating
enhanced efforts to improve overall competitiveness and sustainability.
The growth in labor productivity can be decomposed into: (i) capital intensity or capital deepening
and (ii) growth in total factor productivity (TFP). To further identify contributors to labor
productivity growth, in the report, we utilized the conditional frontier model to investigate the
main contributors to TFP growth among garment and textile subsectors. The conditional frontier
model examines how an industry in Vietnam is operating in relation to the country’s best and most
efficient firm while taking into account the challenges in adopting technologies at the firm level.
As a result,  TFP growth is further decomposed into (i) the increase in technology adoption
investment, allowing firms to adopt technologies that are available in the industry; (ii) the efforts
of frontier firms to adopt leading technologies to lift up the potential technology frontier (conditional
frontier) of the industry; and (iii) the effort of firms at the average level to increase efficiency
through learning by doing, organizational innovation or implementing quality management tools.
The model utilizes the micro-level data from the business survey conducted by GSO.

CURRENT STATE OF THE TEXTILE AND GARMENT INDUSTRY IN VIETNAM
Across most subsectors, capital deepening is the major driver of LP growth. The reliance on capital
investment suggests that firms are focusing on investing in machinery, expanding production
capacity, and intensifying automation. Most subsectors rely heavily on capital deepening to boost
labor productivity growth during the 2009-2022 period. The textile subsector encompassing
activities such as Preparation and Spinning of Textile Fibers, Weaving of Textiles, and Manufacture
of Other Textiles N.E.C. demonstrates a particularly strong reliance on capital deepening, with
over 65% of productivity improvements coming from increased capital per worker. For instance,
Weaving of Textiles and Preparation and Spinning of Textile Fibers report that 70% and 67%,
respectively, of their labor productivity gains are due to capital deepening, highlighting the sector’s
investment in modern machinery, advanced production techniques, and infrastructural upgrades.
This trend reflects the capital-intensive nature of traditional textile production, where machinery
upgrades and new technologies are vital for boosting efficiency and maintaining competitiveness
in global markets.
Conditional Frontier Model
In this report we utilize a conditional frontier model to estimate the impact of technology
adoption on economic growth. In particular, the conditional frontier model examines how
an industry in Vietnam is operating in relation to the country’s best and most efficient firms.
There are two ‘frontiers’ developed: one that takes into consideration all the barriers to
technology adoption (the conditional frontier); and one that looks at how the industry would
operate if all barriers to technology adoption were removed (the unconditional frontier).
In this report, a dynamic version of the conditional frontier model is used, which considers
changes over time. In this dynamic model, the movement of the two frontiers, together with
the movement of the industry average, help to decompose output per worker growth into
different components. In particular, the growth in output per worker can be decomposed
into: (i) capital intensity; (ii) the increase in technology adoption investment, allowing firms
to adopt technologies that are available in the industry; (iii) the efforts of frontier firms to
adopt leading technologies to lift up the potential technology frontier (conditional frontier)
of the industry; and (iv) the effort of firms at the average level to increase efficiency through
learning by doing, organizational innovation, or implementing quality management tools.
The various actions firms can take to increase innovation, as well as the impact these efforts
have on the components of output per worker growth, are summarized in Figure 10 below.

The data of the analysis comes from the Business survey from the General Statistic Office of
Vietnam (GSO). GSO and its sub-institutions have conducted the Enterprise Survey to collect
information on enterprises operating in Vietnam at the end of each year since 2000. This is a
firm-level survey of a representative sample of an economy’s private sector across all
geographic regions. These include enterprises established and regulated by the Enterprise
Law; Cooperatives society/cooperatives union/people’s credit funds operating under the
Cooperative Law, and established enterprises which are subjected to the regulation of
specialized laws such as the Law on Insurance and the Law on Securities.
On the other hand, the garment subsector including Manufacture of Wearing Apparel, Except Fur
Apparel, Manufacture of Fur Apparel, and Manufacture of Knitted and Crocheted Apparel shows
a more balanced approach between capital deepening and TFP growth. Capital deepening accounts
for a lower proportion of labor productivity growth in these subsectors compared to textiles, with
the Manufacture of Wearing Apparel at 55.3% and Manufacture of Knitted and Crocheted Apparel
even lower at 41.2%. This indicates that while capital investments are still important, these garment
subsectors rely more heavily on improvements in TFP. This shift can be attributed to factors such
as labor-intensive production processes, flexible manufacturing systems, and operational efficiency
improvements that allow the garment sector to achieve productivity gains without the same level
of capital investment required in textile manufacturing.

Eﬃciency Improvement
The textile subsector shows a strong reliance on technology investments, with much of its labor
productivity (LP) growth coming from either frontier firms pushing the technological boundaries
or from an increased rate of technology adoption across average firms. For instance, in subsectors
like Preparation and Spinning of Textile Fibers and Weaving of Textiles, we observe that a
significant portion of TFP growth is driven by advancements at the technological frontier (42.3%
and 33.4%, respectively) as well as increased adoption of existing technologies (43.4% and 45.4%,
respectively). This pattern indicates that textile subsectors benefit more directly from investments
that raise both the ceiling of technological capabilities and diffuse these innovations throughout the
industry. In contrast, efficiency improvements, though present, contribute a relatively smaller
share to growth in these subsectors, reflecting a focus on technological rather than operational
advances. Since textile manufacturing requires significant machinery, and while Lean and 5S are
also implemented to improve process efficiency, the emphasis is more on Total Productive
Maintenance (TPM), quality management systems, and energy-saving technologies to optimize
machine uptime and reduce waste in material production. In this sector, tools like Six Sigma are
also used to control quality and reduce variation in production, which is vital in maintaining
consistent fabric quality. However, the full adoption of productivity tools like Lean is somewhat
limited in smaller firms, where traditional practices dominate.
18 | NATIONAL STRATEGY TO BOOST VIETNAM’S TEXTILE AND GARMENT PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY
CURRENT STATE OF THE TEXTILE AND GARMENT INDUSTRY IN VIETNAM
The garment subsector, however, exhibits a more balanced approach between technological
adoption and improvements in operational efficiency through the application of productivity tools.
Sectors such as Manufacture of Wearing Apparel and Manufacture of Fur Apparel highlight the
importance of efficiency improvements, where these tools play a crucial role. For instance, the
Manufacture of Fur Apparel sees 52.3% of its TFP growth stemming from efficiency gains, largely
driven by the adoption of productivity methodologies like 5S, Lean, and other operational
optimizations. The manufacture of wearing apparel, though relying more on technology adoption
to increase labor productivity, also benefits from applying productivity tools (31%).
In general, in the garment subsector, which involves labor-intensive processes like cutting, sewing,
and assembling garments, the adoption of Lean and 5S practices is widespread. This is largely due
to the focus on reducing waste, increasing efficiency, and improving production timelines to meet
fast-changing global demand, particularly in the fashion industry. Lean manufacturing helps in
managing flow, reducing excess inventory, and streamlining operations, which is vital in the
garment sector where production speed and flexibility are critical. This balance between technology
adoption and process improvements positions the garment subsector to achieve sustained
productivity gains through better utilization of existing resources and refined production processes.
2.4 Energy Efficiency and Green Growth: Pioneering Vietnam’s Textile
and Garment Future
Energy efficiency and green growth have become critical imperatives for the textile and garment
industry in Vietnam, driven by both national policies and international obligations. As one of the
world’s most energy-intensive industries, this sector faces mounting pressure to reduce its carbon
footprint and transition to more sustainable practices. The Vietnam National Green Growth Strategy
2021-2030, for example, mandates reductions in energy consumption and carbon emissions as part
of the country’s broader commitment to the Paris Agreement. This aligns with Vietnam’s pledge to
reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Energy consumption is a major concern for Vietnam’s
textile and garment industry, which is highly energy-intensive. The overall energy consumption in
the sector doubled from approximately 2,272 KTOE (thousand tons of oil equivalent) in 2016 to
around 4,226 KTOE in 2020. Figure 12 provides an overview of energy consumption in the textile
and garment sector in Vietnam. NATIONAL STRATEGY TO BOOST VIETNAM’S TEXTILE AND GARMENT PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY | 19

Textile is the third largest energy consumer in the economy in the 2016-2020 period. Energy costs
in Vietnam’s garment factories are also higher compared to regional competitors. Vietnamese firms
spend 1.5 to 1.7 times more on energy than their counterparts in Thailand, China, and Malaysia. In
total, the industry spends approximately USD3 billion annually on energy, with electricity alone
accounting for 8% of production costs. In the dyeing subsector, energy costs make up 14% of
production expenses (IFC 2018). 20 | NATIONAL STRATEGY TO BOOST VIETNAM’S TEXTILE AND GARMENT PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY

Vietnam’s textile subsector, particularly the spinning, weaving, and dyeing stages, presents
enormous potential for resource-efficient upgrades. Dyeing machines and stenter frames are
primary energy consumers, ripe for technological improvements. High-efficiency stenter machines,
thermal oil heaters, and wastewater heat recovery systems have been identified as promising
technologies for reducing both electricity and heat consumption.

However, outdated machinery remains a significant barrier. According to a survey conducted by
VECEA (2017-2018), nearly 13% of dyeing equipment was over 17 years old, while another 34%
was under 10 years old. This reliance on older, less efficient technologies increases not only energy
consumption but also water and chemical usage, reducing the overall competitiveness of Vietnam’s
textile products in global markets.
Furthermore, the industry faces challenges related to intensive water usage in wet processing
stages like dyeing, where machines with liquor ratios of 1:10 to 1:15 consume substantial amounts
of water and produce large volumes of wastewater (VECEA, 2018). This type of machine consumes
large amounts of water, leading to high wastewater treatment costs and associated environmental fees.
In recent years, the textile industry has started implementing green technologies to address these
challenges. New systems for optimizing boilers and steam generation, alongside improved air
supply controls, have demonstrated significant energy savings. Solar energy is also playing an
increasing role, particularly in dyeing operations, where solar thermal technologies are used for hot
water generation. This can potentially meet up to 80% of hot water needs, greatly reducing fuel
costs. Moreover, rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) solutions are becoming more common under
build-lease-transfer (BLT) models, where factories can purchase clean energy generated on-site
without upfront investment. Enterprises are also utilizing automated control systems to manage air
supply and optimize blowdown water based on total dissolved solids (TDS) levels, further
improving energy performance.
On the water treatment front, dyeing facilities have started recovering and reusing water and
thermal energy from high-temperature dyeing machines. Technologies like reverse osmosis (R.O.)
are being applied to recycle treated wastewater back into the dyeing process. These efforts not only
reduce water consumption but also cut down the pollutants in wastewater, making it easier for
factories to comply with environmental regulations.

CURRENT STATE OF THE TEXTILE AND GARMENT INDUSTRY IN VIETNAM
2.4.2 Sustainability in the Garment Subsector: A Growing Trend
Compared to textiles, the garment subsector has seen more progress in implementing energy
efficiency measures. The adoption of LED lighting, energy-efficient sewing machines, and smart
energy management systems has helped reduce energy consumption in production facilities.
International collaborations with brands such as H&M and Nike have accelerated this trend, as
these brands require their suppliers to meet specific sustainability criteria.
The garment subsector, while less energy-intensive than the textile subsector, still has significant
opportunities for energy savings. The industry is dominated by small- to medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs), which often operate with outdated technologies, leading to inefficiencies in both energy
and water consumption. SMEs in the garment sector often lack awareness of energy-saving
technologies or face financial barriers to upgrading their machinery and systems. Key systems
such as sewing machines, air compressors, irons, and lighting consume significant amounts of
energy, offering substantial opportunities for savings through modernization.
Many factories in the garment subsector are turning to solar energy for their energy needs. Solar
panel installations on factory rooftops provide renewable energy, reducing reliance on grid
electricity. Notable projects, such as the installation of 11 MWp of solar PV rooftop systems by Tan
De Company, one of Vietnam’s largest garment exporters, demonstrate the sector’s shift toward
cleaner energy. These systems are expected to generate 12,603 MWh annually and reduce 8,527 tons
of CO2 emissions per year, aligning Vietnamese manufacturers with international green standards.
Global brands are playing a crucial role in advancing sustainability efforts among Vietnamese
garment factories, with companies like H&M Group setting ambitious targets to reduce their
environmental impact. H&M, for example, aims to significantly reduce its greenhouse gas
emissions and transition entirely to renewable electricity in its operations by 2030, based on 2019
levels, with an overarching objective of achieving net-zero emissions by 2040 (HM Group 2022).
The company’s sustainability strategy includes reducing reliance on virgin materials by
incorporating more recycled content into its products. Additionally, H&M is actively working to
phase out coal-based energy in its supply chain, especially in Vietnam. To this end, the brand has
halted partnerships with new suppliers using on-site coal boilers and provides financial support to
existing factories, enabling them to adopt energy-efficient technologies and sustainable alternatives
to fossil fuels. This comprehensive approach underscores H&M’s commitment to fostering a
greener, more sustainable garment manufacturing industry in Vietnam.
Despite these advancements, the garment subsector still faces considerable challenges. Many
Vietnamese garment factories, especially SMEs, operate with outdated equipment, impacting both
energy and water efficiency. High energy-consuming equipment, such as sewing machines, air
compressors, irons, and lighting systems, often remains in use due to the prohibitive costs of
modernizing. While advanced automation technologies like smart sensors and real-time energy
management systems are available, financial and knowledge barriers make their adoption
difficult for SMEs.
NATIONAL STRATEGY TO BOOST VIETNAM’S TEXTILE AND GARMENT PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY | 23
CURRENT STATE OF THE TEXTILE AND GARMENT INDUSTRY IN VIETNAM
In addition, the traditional structure of the clothing industry often prioritizes low costs and rapid
turnaround times, which can conflict with sustainability goals. Transitioning to more eco-friendly
production practices involves addressing significant challenges:
Costs of Sustainable Practices: Using organic materials and adopting eco-friendly technologies
increase production costs. This can lead to higher retail prices, posing a challenge in a market
largely driven by fast fashion.
Supply Chain Transparency: The complexity of global supply chains makes it challenging to
ensure sustainable practices across all stages, from sourcing materials to production and
distribution.
Consumer Awareness and Market Demand: Although consumer awareness of environmental
impact is growing, many buyers still prioritize affordability. Sustainable brands must navigate
this price-sensitive market while promoting the value of ethical production.
Scalability: While smaller-scale sustainable practices are achievable, scaling them up for large
volumes presents additional costs and logistical complexities.
Regulatory Framework: The absence of uniform sustainability standards and enforcement
mechanisms across countries hinders broader adoption of sustainable practices.
Certification and Verification: Obtaining certifications such as Fair Trade or Organic can be
time-consuming and expensive, especially for SMEs. Ensuring these standards are upheld
across complex supply chains requires dedicated resources.
Technical Innovation: The industry still requires advancements in developing eco-friendly
materials and production processes that reduce waste and energy use.
Fast Fashion Competition: The continued popularity of fast fashion, with its low costs and rapid
product turnover, poses a significant obstacle to the widespread adoption of sustainable practices
within the garment sector.
These challenges underscore the need for a concerted effort among manufacturers, brands,
regulatory bodies, and consumers to transform Vietnam’s garment subsector into a model of ethical
and sustainable production. While progress is being made, comprehensive and sustained efforts
will be essential to make lasting change. Automation technologies, such as smart sensors and
control systems, are helping optimize energy usage by responding to real-time demand, thus
reducing energy waste. In addition, regular maintenance of equipment and process optimization
can prevent energy and water losses in garment factories. 24 | NATIONAL STRATEGY TO BOOST VIETNAM’S TEXTILE AND GARMENT PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY

2.5 Supply Chain Participation
Vietnam’s integration into the global textile and garment supply chain has intensified in recent
years, driven by competitive manufacturing advantages and key trade agreements such as the
Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the EU-
Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA). These agreements provide preferential market access,
boosting foreign direct investment (FDI) and embedding Vietnam even further into global networks.
Vietnam’s textile and garment industry is supported by a well-established production network,
ranging from raw material processing to the export of finished garments. This network consists of
a diverse range of SMEs and larger firms, creating a flexible and adaptable production ecosystem.
This allows Vietnam to respond rapidly to shifting global demands and trends, enhancing its
competitiveness in the international market.
A diverse production landscape characterizes Vietnam’s textile and garment supply chain, which
can be divided into design, raw material production, manufacturing, and branding/marketing
stages. These stages present distinct challenges and opportunities that influence the industry’s
efficiency and competitiveness. However, discrepancies between the textile and garment sectors
are evident, particularly in terms of raw material dependence and net export performance.

TNG Investment and Trading JSC
A notable example of effective energy efficiency practices is TNG Investment and Trading
JSC, a prominent textile and garment manufacturer in Vietnam. Beginning in 2018, TNG
undertook a significant energy efficiency initiative supported by the VNEEIP. The company’s
approach included a comprehensive set of upgrades to optimize energy use and reduce
carbon emissions (VNEEIP, 2022). Key upgrades included the replacement of outdated
boilers with high-efficiency models, the transition to LED lighting, and the modernization
of production equipment and HVAC systems. These measures improved fuel combustion
efficiency from 70% to 85%, resulting in a 15% reduction in fuel consumption
Additionally, the switch to LED lighting achieved a 30% reduction in electricity use for
lighting. Upgrades to production machinery and HVAC systems also contributed to a 20%
decrease in energy consumption, leading to annual cost savings of approximately VND10.5
billion (about USD450,000) and a reduction in carbon emissions by approximately 18,000
tons per year (TNG Investment and Trading JSC, 2019). TNG’s successful energy efficiency
program earned the Vietnam Energy Efficiency Award in 2019, recognizing the company’s
best practices in energy management and serving as a model for the Southeast Asian textile

2.5.1 Textile Sector: Reliance on Imported Input
Vietnam’s textile sector remains highly dependent on imported raw materials, particularly yarns
and fabrics, which are mostly sourced from competitive neighboring countries such as China, the
Republic of Korea (ROK), the Republic of China (ROC), and Thailand. In 2020, 60% of the textiles
used for garment production were imported, with China being the primary supplier. Key categories
like cotton, man-made filaments, and knitted fabrics consistently show a negative trade balance,
highlighting the challenges of building a competitive domestic textile supply chain.
In 2020, Vietnam faced a USD10.9 billion trade deficit in cotton and a USD12.3 billion deficit in
man-made filaments (Figure 16). The only positive balance was seen in textile fabrics (HS59),
which had a surplus of USD365 million. Similarly, man-made filaments (HS54) registered large
negative net exports, reaching USD14.02 billion in 2019 before improving to USD12.35 billion in
2020. While the trade deficit in knitted fabrics (HS60) remained significant, the industry recorded
a surplus in textile fabrics (HS59), achieving positive net exports ranging from USD309 million in
2017 to USD443 million in 2019. These figures reveal the significant gap between the success of
the garment sector and the underdevelopment of the domestic textile industry, which is still reliant
on imports for essential materials.
2.5.2 Garment Sector: Strong Export Growth but Limited Value Addition
The textile and garment industry in Vietnam is heavily oriented towards exports, with approximately
85-87% of its production targeted at international markets. In 2022, Vietnam exported textiles
worth USD48.8 billion, making it the third-largest textile exporter in the world. That same year,
textiles ranked as the second most exported product in Vietnam, reflecting the sector’s significance
to the national economy. The primary destinations for Vietnam’s textile exports include the USA,
which accounted for USD19.1 billion, followed by Japan at USD4.72 billion, the ROK at USD4.39
billion, China at USD3.52 billion, and Canada at USD1.57 billion (OEC, 2024).
One of the key drivers behind the 6.3% increase in Vietnam’s textile and garment exports in 2022
was the surge in global demand. Rising consumer demand in major markets, including the USA,
Europe, and Asia, has led to increased orders for Vietnamese textiles and apparel. Additionally, the
post-pandemic recovery has created a surge in orders as countries seek to restock their inventories
and satisfy pent-up consumer demand, further propelling export growth.
Diversification of Export Markets: In recent years, Vietnam has made concerted efforts to
diversify its export markets beyond traditional destinations like the USA and the EU. This
strategic shift has allowed Vietnam to tap into emerging markets in Asia, Africa, and the Middle
East, forging new trade partnerships and creating lucrative opportunities for its textile and
garment exports. By expanding its market reach, Vietnam aims to reduce dependency on a
limited number of export destinations, ensuring a more stable and resilient export base.
Strategic Investments in Technology and Innovation: Vietnam’s textile and garment sector has
also benefited from strategic investments in technology and innovation. Manufacturers are
increasingly embracing automation, digitalization, and sustainable practices to enhance
efficiency, productivity, and quality in their production processes. This focus on modernization
not only improves operational efficiency but also positions Vietnam as a competitive player
in the global textile market, capable of meeting evolving consumer demands and
sustainability standards.

CURRENT STATE OF THE TEXTILE AND GARMENT INDUSTRY IN VIETNAM
Strategic Trade Agreements: The presence of key trade agreements has further bolstered the
industry’s growth. Agreements such as the CPTPP and the EVFTA have provided Vietnam with
tariff reductions and improved market access. These agreements have enhanced the
competitiveness of Vietnamese textiles and garments on the international stage, enabling the
country to capture a larger market share and attract new customers.
Vietnam’s garment sector has demonstrated remarkable export growth, particularly in knitted and
woven garments (HS61 and HS62). The efficiency of its production system and competitive pricing
have made Vietnam a significant player in global apparel markets. Notably, the country has
experienced substantial surpluses in both knitted and woven garments. For instance, net exports of
knitted garments rose from USD20.34 billion in 2017 to USD25.66 billion in 2019, before declining
slightly to USD23.33 billion in 2020. Similarly, net exports of woven garments increased from
USD9.55 billion in 2017 to a peak of USD11.49 billion in 2019, then decreased to USD10.82
billion in 2020.
Despite the impressive export figures, a critical challenge facing the garment sector is the reliance
on CMT production processes, which yield lower value addition compared to activities such as
design and raw material sourcing. This focus on CMT limits the industry’s ability to capture more
value within the global supply chain. Moreover, garment manufacturers remain dependent on
imported fabrics, underscoring the urgent need for stronger backward linkages within the domestic
supply chain. Enhancing local sourcing capabilities and fostering a more integrated supply chain
could not only improve value addition but also increase the resilience of the garment sector against
global market fluctuations.
2.5.3 The Vibrant Domestic Market
In recent years, Vietnam’s domestic fashion market has become increasingly vibrant, driven by
rising disposable incomes and evolving consumer preferences. Young consumers, particularly
those in Generation Z, are greatly influenced by social media and digital platforms like Shopee,
Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. Their shopping behaviors are shaped by online content related to
skin care, makeup, accessories, and footwear, while a significant proportion of older consumers
have adapted to remote purchasing, reflecting a growing expectation for a seamless
shopping experience.
A survey conducted by Vinatex indicated a promising outlook for the apparel and textile sectors,
with consumer spending on clothing ranking just behind food. The average monthly expenditure
on clothing among respondents ranged from 150,000 to 500,000 VND, accounting for about 18%
of their total spending. Furthermore, nearly 70% of Vietnamese consumers reported shopping for
garments at least twice a month during the survey period (WTO Center, 2024).
In response to these market dynamics, Vietnamese garment companies are actively expanding their
distribution systems across the country. Despite the current dominance of Chinese-made products
in the local market, Vietnamese-made garments are gradually gaining traction. VinatexMart has
emerged as the leading retailer of locally made garments and fabrics, with major brands like Viet
Tien, Phong Phu, May 10, and Nha Be operating over 1,000 retail stores nationwide (Vinatex,
2024). This success is attributed to diversification in design, brand development, and an expanded
distribution network, as noted by Than Duc Viet, Executive Director of May 10.

CURRENT STATE OF THE TEXTILE AND GARMENT INDUSTRY IN VIETNAM
Recognizing the importance of sustainable development in the domestic market, Vietnamese
businesses have focused on improving product quality and diversifying their offerings to ensure
accessibility for consumers. Vietnam’s textile and garment industry is currently concentrated on
export markets. However, it is crucial to also consider the potential of the domestic market. The
industry’s production capacity stands at approximately USD50 billion, indicating that while the
domestic market capacity may be smaller, it remains significant.
The domestic garment market in Vietnam has long been served by a diverse array of small local
businesses, ranging from large private companies to informal, small-scale workshops. While
export-oriented garment firms are larger and more formalized, these local firms have managed to
meet international standards in terms of technology. Interestingly, they have also been involved in
more complex processes beyond just CMT operations, including design and marketing, which are
typically knowledge-intensive activities. Some domestic brands that are considered to have a
foothold in the market such as Viet Tien, Nha Be, An Phuoc, and Garment 10 mainly focus on the
office product segment.
The domestic fashion industry has become more vibrant, with the rise of young designers and
emerging brands. Local products, often sold through traditional markets, street vendors, and
e-commerce platforms, remain popular due to their affordability. The government has also
supported fashion incubators and initiatives to foster creativity and innovation in local design.

Despite these opportunities, the domestic market presents challenges as well. Businesses need to
continuously innovate and adapt to new consumer trends to develop effective strategies. Improving
product quality and offering unique, valuable products are essential for competitiveness. For
instance, companies like Phong Phu and Viet Thang reported revenues exceeding VND1 trillion
(approximately USD47.6 million) from domestic sales last year.
However, despite this wider involvement, domestic firms tend to operate at a lower level of
technological sophistication and value addition. This gap is largely due to the limited transfer of
advanced technology from more developed countries, which has created a notable “export
premium” (Goto, 2014). As a result, two distinct value chains one domestic and the other export-
oriented have evolved side by side with very little interaction between them. The reorientation
toward local markets is expected to reshape value chains and shift priorities for many companies.
New market players may emerge, driving further change in the organization of supply chains and
the broader textile and garment industry landscape in Vietnam.

3. MEGATRENDS IN THE TEXTILE AND
GARMENT INDUSTRY IN VIETNAM
A megatrend is a long-term, pervasive shift that gradually gains momentum and reshapes the
economy. These trends emerge at the intersection of several smaller, time-specific trends. The
megatrends analysis for Vietnam’s textile and garment industry was conducted using horizon
scanning, a process that identified key economic, technological, social, geopolitical, legal, and
environmental trends expected to impact the sector. This analysis was further refined through
interviews (see Appendix 1 for interview methodology) and workshops with key stakeholders
including businesses and researchers in the industry held in Hanoi in July and October 2024.
The input from these stakeholders provided valuable insights into the forces shaping the future of
the industry. Based on this comprehensive review, the research team identified seven megatrends
that are expected to drive Vietnam’s textile and garment industry up to 2045 (Figure 19). These
megatrends will influence everything from market demands to the adoption of advanced
technologies, regulatory changes, and sustainability initiatives.

3.1 Sustainability and Circular Fashion
Brands and end-users are increasingly concerned about environmental, social, and governance
(ESG), driving regulatory changes to align with these demands. Due to the significant impact of
the apparel industry on the environment, contributing to 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions
as well as increasing landfill and pollution (McKinsey & Company, 2023), sustainability concerns
continue to be the focus of the sector. In 2018, stakeholders in the garment sector committed to
climate action through the UNFCCC Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action. Signatories
pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030 (from a 2015 baseline) and achieve
net-zero emissions by 2050. Achieving this reduction requires system-level changes in the
production and consumption of textiles and garments regardless of location. As one of the major
exporters of textile and garment products, going green is an inevitable trend for Vietnam.
Vietnamese textile and garment enterprises are required to develop environmentally friendly
products in line with sustainability trends and meet the strict requirements of markets such as the
EU, the USA, and Japan. A report by Boston Consulting Group indicates that over the next two to
four years, more than 35 new pieces of sustainability-linked regulation are expected to go into
effect around the world, targeting import restrictions, product design guidelines, labeling
requirements, and more (Jensen et al., 2023). Figure 20 provides a snapshot of some regulatory
frameworks related to sustainability.
3.1.1 Stringent Regulatory Framework on Sustainability
Vietnam participates in 16 Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), which require certified origins,
sustainable production, and transparent production information for tax relief on exports. To
leverage FTAs, Vietnamese businesses must innovate across their operations to remain competitive.
Major importing countries are setting requirements for social responsibility, environmentally
friendly production, and circular production with the lowest energy and natural resource
consumption. For example, the EU’s target for full circularity by 2030 intensifies regulatory
pressure on the industry, compelling apparel manufacturers to address issues across circularity,
traceability, and decarbonization (McKinsey & Company, 2023). Future strategies must focus on
complying with stricter origin identification requirements and preparing for potential future taxes
like the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment
Mechanism (CBAM).
The introduction of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) by the EU marks a
significant shift in global climate policy, with notable implications for the fashion and textile
industry. Designed to level the playing field between EU producers and their international
counterparts, CBAM imposes a carbon price on imports from outside the EU. This approach aims
to prevent “carbon leakage,” where companies might relocate production to countries with less
stringent emissions regulations. By imposing these costs, CBAM encourages cleaner production
processes and promotes the adoption of more sustainable practices on a global scale.

For the fashion and textile industry, renowned for its substantial carbon emissions and environmental
impact, the introduction of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) represents both a
challenge and an opportunity. Non-EU manufacturers may face higher costs due to the carbon
price, which could lead to increased consumer prices or reduced profit margins. This financial
pressure is likely to encourage the industry to adopt more carbon-efficient production methods.
CBAM also acts as a catalyst for the integration of sustainable technologies and practices,
prompting brands to invest in energy-efficient production methods and circular economy models
to alleviate the financial impact. Additionally, CBAM will require greater transparency and
accountability within supply chains. Companies must gain a clearer understanding of their supply
chain emissions, fostering more responsible and sustainable practices.
In response to similar regulatory frameworks, such as the ROK’s “Framework Act on Carbon
Neutrality and Green Growth for Coping with Climate Crisis,” manufacturers are expected to
obtain certifications like ISO 14067 for Product Carbon Footprint Verification, ISO 14001 for
Environmental Management Systems, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and ISO 26000. In
Vietnam, about 50% of textile enterprises have adopted green production methods, and
approximately 80% have invested in rooftop solar power (Quynh Trang, 2023). NATIONAL STRATEGY TO BOOST VIETNAM’S TEXTILE AND GARMENT PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY | 33
MEGATRENDS IN THE TEXTILE AND GARMENT INDUSTRY IN VIETNAM
The Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) mandates large EU companies
(over EUR150 million in global turnover and 500+ employees) and large non-EU companies (with
EU-wide revenue over EUR300 million) to conduct environmental and human rights due diligence
across their operations, subsidiaries, and value chains starting in 2027. The scope of CSDDD will
expand in future years, placing a significant compliance burden on companies with extensive
international value chains (Brennan, Gonzalez, Puzniak-Holford, Kilsby, & Subramoni, 2024).
In Vietnam, the Prime Minister issued Decision No. 1643/QD-TTg, approving the “Vietnam Textile
and Garment Industry Development Strategy to 2030, Vision to 2035.” This strategy envisions the
industry evolving sustainably within a circular economy model by 2035. It focuses on resource
efficiency, waste reduction, and improved environmental and social performance. The strategy sets
ambitious targets for reducing the industry’s environmental impact by 2030, including a 15%
reduction in energy consumption and a 20% reduction in water use by 2023, contributing to long-
term sustainability (Viet Nam News, 2022).
3.1.2 Buyer Expectations and Standards about Sustainability
Stringent regulations and growing consumer awareness of environmental concerns are driving
stricter requirements from buyers, particularly those representing major brands and international
chains. These buyers are restructuring their global supply chains to meet rigorous sustainability
targets, which emphasize improved environmental performance, the use of recycled and organic
materials, reduced energy consumption, and the conservation of non-renewable resources like
water and fossil fuels (WWF Vietnam, 2022). More than 85% of leading brands have publicly
declared decarbonization targets for their supply chains (Jensen, et al., 2023). Figure 21 provides
a snapshot of some popular sustainability standards and tools.
Net Zero Carbon Emissions: Achieving net zero carbon emissions is a crucial goal for the
industry, necessitating a focus on sustainable manufacturing and supply chain practices. Companies
are working towards reducing their carbon footprint by adopting energy-efficient technologies and
processes, and transitioning to renewable energy sources. This commitment extends to minimizing
greenhouse gas emissions across all stages of production and distribution. A key initiative in this
shift is the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). The SBTi provides a framework for companies
to set and achieve science-based emissions reduction targets. For example, Levi’s has had its net-
zero emissions target for 2050 approved by the SBTi. The company has updated its near-term goals
to a 42% reduction in its Scope 3 emissions by 2030, based on a new baseline year of 2022
(Ecotextile, 2024). Similarly, Nike is advancing its sustainability agenda by promoting renewable
energy use among its suppliers. The company’s approach includes supporting the installation of
solar photovoltaic systems on factory rooftops, advocating for policies that enable direct renewable
energy sourcing from local utilities, and expanding its biomass renewable energy program with a
focus on material manufacturers. In FY23, renewable energy use by suppliers increased by 50%,
with renewables accounting for a fifth of energy sourced (Derrick, 2024). Nike is also organizing
supplier working groups to accelerate the adoption of renewable energy across multiple countries.

MEGATRENDS IN THE TEXTILE AND GARMENT INDUSTRY IN VIETNAM
Manufacturing environment: There are increasing requirements about manufacturing practices
including factories’ energy and environmental standards. For example, LEED standard is an
international benchmark for high-performance green buildings, offering benefits such as reduced
energy and water consumption, lower operating costs, and improved market access through
enhanced sustainability credentials. Pearl Global Vietnam achieved LEED O&M Gold certification
in April 2024, becoming the first garment factory in Vietnam to receive this certification (Bureau
Veritas, 2024). Bureau Veritas conducted a feasibility study at the factory to evaluate its energy and
water consumption, indoor air quality, waste management practices, and other sustainability
criteria. In addition, the Higg Facility Environmental Module (FEM) 4.0 launched in 2023 is a
comprehensive assessment tool that requires all subcontractors and factories to self-evaluate and
verify their environmental performance (Cascale, 2023). This emphasizes more rigorous reporting
and accountability, driving further improvements in environmental practices within the industry.
Sustainable Product Certification: For apparel exports, there is a growing preference for products
with certifications for recycled content, organic materials, and adherence to Restricted Substances
Lists (RSLs). Compliance with Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) is also
increasingly important. These certifications are becoming essential for gaining market access and
Energy and Waste Management: There is a strong push to eliminate the use of coal and fossil
fuels in factory operations (Leal Filho et al., 2024). Instead, companies are investing in solar
energy installations and adopting environmentally friendly practices such as reducing greenhouse
gas emissions and using eco-friendly air conditioning systems. Waste management strategies are
evolving to prioritize recycling, reuse, and reduction of landfill and incineration (McKinsey &
Company, 2022). By adopting these practices, the industry aims to minimize its environmental
footprint and enhance sustainability.
Social Responsibility: Social responsibility remains a vital aspect of sustainability, emphasizing
gender equality, worker welfare, and improved working conditions (Balchin, 2023). Key
components include ensuring safe, healthy work environments, fair wages, and respect for labor
rights. Labor issues persist in Vietnam, with Better Work Vietnam (2023) reporting that one in four
factories were non-compliant in areas like occupational safety and health. Compliance with social
responsibility standards such as Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (WRAP), Business
Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI), Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA), and Social &
Labor Convergence Program (SLCP), and Better Work is essential for fostering ethical practices
and upholding labor rights throughout the supply chain.
In summary, the fashion industry’s increasing emphasis on sustainability encompasses a multi-
faceted approach involving material choices, environmental management, product certification,
energy and waste practices, and social responsibility. These efforts are driving the industry towards
more sustainable practices and contributing to its growth and evolution in a way that aligns with
global sustainability goals. NATIONAL STRATEGY TO BOOST VIETNAM’S TEXTILE AND GARMENT PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY | 35

Opportunities and challenges
Opportunities
Challenges
Market access and profitability: Suppliers who
meet sustainability requirements will not only
become more competitive but also attract more
orders. By leveraging green standards and
certifications such as ISO 14001, eco-labels, and
product certifications, suppliers can enhance their
market access and appeal to environmentally
conscious consumers. These certifications can also
serve as powerful marketing tools, potentially
allowing suppliers to command higher prices for
their green products.
Participation in the carbon market: Companies
can offset their emissions, purchase carbon
credits, and meet emission reduction targets,
which helps manage costs associated with carbon
emissions. There are also opportunities to
generate carbon credits through sustainable
practices and investment in green projects.
Reducing costs: Brands and manufacturers that
have proactively adopted sustainable and circular
production practices are well-positioned to
benefit under mechanisms like CBAM. These
practices, which focus on reducing carbon
footprints and utilizing sustainable materials and
technologies, can lead to increased operational
efficiency and cost savings. Lower carbon
emissions reduce the risk of facing additional
legal costs or penalties. Additionally, such
practices can strengthen a company’s market
position, especially in environmentally conscious
markets like the EU. The focus on sustainability
can also lead to reduced production costs and
improved profitability.
Government Support: Companies engaged in
sustainable production may receive various forms
of government support, including financial
assistance and favorable policies. This support can
help offset the costs associated with transitioning
to more sustainable practices and enhance a
company’s ability to compete in the market. By
aligning with government policies that promote
sustainability, businesses can benefit from
incentives and assistance that bolster their
operational efficiency and market presence.
Complexity of the regulatory landscape: The
financial burden of transitioning to low-carbon
production methods and the administrative
complexities of compliance can be particularly
overwhelming for businesses, especially SMEs.
Approximately 87% of Vietnam’s textile and
garment companies are SMEs, each employing
fewer than 300 workers and with total assets
under USD2 million (GSO, 2022).
Financial strain and investment barriers: Shifting
towards sustainable and circular production
requires substantial capital investment, straining
companies especially SMEs. More than 80% of SMEs
lack the capital necessary for investing in green
production and achieving green certifications such
as LEED and LOTUS (Thanh Thuy, 2024). Currently,
less than 10% of factories meet LEED standards,
with most compliant facilities being foreign direct
investment (FDI) enterprises.
Supply chain and infrastructure challenges: The
textile industry in Vietnam is further challenged
by its heavy reliance on imported raw materials,
making it difficult for businesses to ensure quality
and sustainability throughout the supply chain.
Additionally, there is a shortage of large-scale
industrial zones specifically designed for garment
and textile production, including those with
wastewater treatment systems. The industry also
suffers from a lack of skilled human resources
necessary for implementing Industry 4.0
technologies.
Lack of strategic planning: Many SMEs lack
strategic planning, often prioritizing short-term
objectives over long-term sustainability goals.
This is partly influenced by current market
dynamics, where consumer awareness of
sustainable fashion remains limited, and
willingness to pay a premium for sustainable
products is still relatively low. In addition, SMEs
face intense competition from traditional
businesses that can produce goods at lower costs,
placing significant pressure on sustainable
enterprises to remain competitive while upholding
higher environmental and ethical standards.

3.2 Geopolitical Trade Shifts
The textile trade’s reliance on smooth global transportation makes it vulnerable to conflicts and
unrest in key regions like Russia, the Middle East, and parts of the EU. USA leadership in creating
political stability is crucial for stabilizing trade. The Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (GSCPI)
(Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 2024) indicates a return to pre-pandemic levels, but companies
are not reverting to previous supply chains. The pandemic and geopolitical changes are driving
long-term shifts, such as reducing dependence on Asia and increasing automation. Companies are
regionalizing production and expanding their supplier networks to enhance resilience.
GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN PRESSURE INDEX (GSCPI)
Source: Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 2024
-1 3.2.1 Increasing Focus on Asia: Greater Competition and Unstable Political Environment
The fashion industry faces multiple crises, from logistical issues due to the Red Sea crisis, the
Israel-Palestine conflict, to increased energy prices from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and inflation
affecting consumer spending (Rabe & Wiggins, 2024). The fallout between Russia and the West
also has a disruptive impact on the energy sector which will affect other commodities as Western
sanctions on Russia take effect and Western Europe weans itself from its dependence on Russian
oil and gas. Russian trade will shift from Europe to other regions, particularly China and India. On
the other hand, geopolitical tensions between the USA and China have led firms to adopt nearshoring
and ‘China+1’ sourcing strategies, aiming to reduce reliance on China and diversify production
(EY, 2023). 38 | NATIONAL STRATEGY TO BOOST VIETNAM’S TEXTILE AND GARMENT PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY
MEGATRENDS IN THE TEXTILE AND GARMENT INDUSTRY IN VIETNAM
3.2.2 Nearshoring
Manufacturing activities are moving closer to major consumer markets in the EU and the USA, a
trend known as ‘nearshoring’ (Monaghan, 2023). This shift aims to shorten supply chains and
reduce risks associated with long-distance production. However, a complete decoupling from
China is unlikely due to the continued reliance on Chinese fabrics and components, as well as the
significant Chinese consumer market.
3.2.3 ‘China+1’ Sourcing Strategy
Since the early 2010s, rising labor costs in China have driven the ‘China+1’ strategy, reducing
China’s share of global apparel exports from 43% in 2010 to 31% in 2019. This decline has been
exacerbated by the US-China trade war, which imposed tariffs up to 7.5% on Chinese textiles and
apparel, and the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) (Maile & Staritz, 2024). Apparel
brands are diversifying their supply chains, with Vietnam and Bangladesh emerging as key
beneficiaries. However, China is still a large supplier due to the ongoing reliance of lead firms
particularly on fabric supply from China, as well as ancillary components such as trims, buttons,
and zippers.
3.2.4 Continued Influence of the Asia-Pacific Region
The Asia-Pacific textile market is projected to grow from USD391.20 billion in 2024 to USD443.72
billion by 2029, at a CAGR of 2.55% (Research and Markets, 2024). The Asia-Pacific region
remains a powerhouse in the global textile and apparel trade. As a global leader, the region holds a
60.7% market share, including 60.1% in apparel, 60.5% in home textiles, and 62% of raw textile
exports (Fibre2Fashion, 2024). This dominance highlights the region’s dynamic industry,
emphasizing the importance of intra-regional trade for risk management and market expansion.
China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and India are key players in this market, driven by strong demand
and internal consumption (CICC Research, 2024).
3.2.5 Emerging Markets: Opportunities to Service Chinese Market
The reconfiguration of global supply chains due to rising labor costs in China and geopolitical
considerations is expected to cause significant changes to China’s role as a major supplier.
Companies have started diversifying their sourcing to other Asian countries to better manage
production risks and costs. This strategic shift helps mitigate the impacts of potential disruptions
and leverages the benefits of a more diversified supply chain. China is expected to lose its share of
trade partners’ imports in textiles, where it has been a concentrated supplier (Song, White, Birsha,
& Woetz, 2024). At the same time, this represents a significant export opportunity for Vietnam with

due to unfilled or under-filled orders. In addition, the vast majority of workers in garment
enterprises are migrant workers from rural areas of Vietnam, where factory jobs offer significantly
higher wages compared to agricultural work. This wage differential often compels workers to
endure challenging working conditions and overlook labor law violations. To address these issues,
the garment industry must focus on maintaining strong relationships with its workforce and invest
in training and retention strategies to remain competitive in an increasingly dynamic labor market.
3.6.2.2 Increasing Competition from Other Industries
In addition to the competitive nature of the labor market, the garment industry faces competition
from other rapidly growing sectors such as construction, furniture, and electronics (Figure 26)
because it is perceived as demanding and labor-intensive. Many workers see it as requiring
repetitive tasks with limited career advancement opportunities. This perception is compounded by
concerns over working conditions, which can include exposure to chemicals and a physically
demanding environment. The nature of the work in textile manufacturing, which often involves
long hours and manual labor, contrasts sharply with the more advanced and cleaner environments
associated with high-tech industries (International Labour Organization, 2022).

MEGATRENDS IN THE TEXTILE AND GARMENT INDUSTRY IN VIETNAM
High-tech sectors, such as electronics, offer more appealing work environments and career
prospects. These industries are associated with higher wages, cleaner and safer workplaces, and
opportunities for professional growth and development. The advanced nature of technology in
these fields, combined with the higher skill requirements, makes them more attractive to potential
employees. Electronics and other tech industries also typically offer more appealing benefits and a
greater emphasis on innovation, which can be more motivating for prospective workers.
Furthermore, the textile industry’s reliance on chemicals and the labor-intensive nature of its
processes contribute to its less favorable image. The potential health risks associated with chemical
exposure and the physically demanding tasks involved can deter individuals from pursuing careers
in this sector. In contrast, industries like electronics are often perceived as offering safer working
conditions and a more modern, technologically advanced work environment.
3.6.3 The Importance of Education and Training
Establishing comprehensive vocational training programs and fostering collaboration with
universities and research institutes are critical measures to ensure the supply of skilled labor that
meets the industry’s increasingly sophisticated requirements (Asia Development Bank, 2023). To
succeed in this new era, workers will need a broad range of qualifications and skills. Knowledge in
ICT, basic information technology, and the ability to use and interact with smart machines will be
essential. Understanding machine-to-machine communication, IT security, and data protection will
also be critical. Additionally, workers will need to be skilled in data literacy, including the ability
to process and analyze data, interpret visual data outputs, and make informed decisions based on
this information. A strong foundation in technical know-how, particularly in manufacturing
processes and machine maintenance, will be crucial, along with personal skills such as adaptability,
decision-making, teamwork, and communication. Importantly, a mindset geared towards lifelong
learning will be essential for success in the rapidly evolving landscape of Industry 4.0 (Cugno,
Castagnoli, & Büchi, 2021).
Overall, to remain competitive in this challenging labor market, the textile industry needs to
address these perceptions by improving working conditions, investing in cleaner technologies, and
enhancing career development opportunities. By making the sector more attractive to potential
employees and emphasizing advancements such as automation and technology integration, the
industry can better compete with high-tech sectors for skilled talent.

4. SCENARIOS FOR VIETNAM’S TEXTILE
AND GARMENT INDUSTRY: A GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSIS
OF GREEN GROWTH AND GLOBAL
TECHNOLOGIES TO ENHANCE
4.1 Scenario Design
This study employs the Global Trade and Environment Model (GTEM) – a recursive dynamic,
multi-country, and multi-region computable general equilibrium (CGE) framework developed by
the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) – to analyze economic
activities (Nong et al., 2023, Lu et al., 2024). We employ the Global Trade Analysis Project
database version 10a (which represents the world economy in 2014), with 141 countries and
regions1 and 65 sectors2 (Aguiar et al., 2019). For this study, the data is aggregated into 22 countries/
regions including Vietnam and its key textile and garment trading partners and 46 industrial
sectors, focusing on the textile and garment supply chains (see Appendix 2 for more details on the
model and database). NATIONAL STRATEGY TO BOOST VIETNAM’S TEXTILE AND GARMENT PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY | 55

OF GREEN GROWTH AND GLOBAL TECHNOLOGIES TO ENHANCE COMPETITIVENESS
DESCRIPTION OF A CGE MODEL
A recursive dynamic multi-region, multi-sector computable general equilibrium (CGE)
model is a powerful economic modeling tool used by researchers and policymakers to
simulate and analyze the impacts of policy changes, economic shocks, technological
development, and structural transformations over time across multiple regions and sectors.
It helps decision-makers understand how economies might evolve under different scenarios,
taking into account the complex interactions between industries, regions, and households.
Key Features of a Recursive Dynamic CGE Model
1. Multi-Region Framework:
What It Means: The model covers multiple geographic regions (e.g., countries or
groups of countries). Each region is treated as an individual economy with its own
resources, industries, and consumer behavior. However, the regions are interconnected
through trade, investment, and financial flows.
Why It Matters: This allows for the analysis of how changes in one region (such as a
new trade policy or economic growth) can affect other regions, making it essential for
understanding global and regional economic integration, trade agreements, or
international cooperation.
2. Multi-Sector Structure:
What It Means: The model divides each regional economy into multiple sectors or
industries, such as agriculture, manufacturing, services, and energy. Each sector interacts
with others, both as suppliers of inputs (e.g., fibers) and as consumers of outputs (e.g.,
households buying wearing apparel).
Why It Matters: This enables the evaluation of sector-specific policies or shocks (like
carbon taxes or technological innovations) and their cascading effects on the broader
economy. It also helps in understanding sectoral impacts on employment, production,
and consumption.
3. Recursive Dynamic Approach:
What It Means: The model is dynamic, meaning it captures changes over time, but it
follows a recursive structure. This means it solves the model year by year, where the
outcomes of one year (like capital accumulation or labor market conditions) influence
the next. However, agents in the economy (e.g., firms and households) typically make
decisions based on current conditions rather than perfect foresight of the future.
Why It Matters: This approach allows for analyzing the evolution of economies over
the medium to long term, such as the impact of gradual reforms or infrastructure
investments. It also captures cumulative effects, such as how policy or technological
changes in one year can lead to larger changes over decades.
4. General Equilibrium Nature:
What It Means: A CGE model captures the equilibrium across all markets (goods,
services, labor, and capital) simultaneously. It accounts for how supply and demand
interact across different markets to determine prices, production levels, and consumption
patterns.
Why It Matters: This provides a comprehensive view of how changes in one part of the
economy (such as a tax on carbon emissions or a change in labor policy or technological
innovations) will ripple through all markets, affecting prices, production, trade, and
income distribution. It highlights trade-offs and synergies between policies.

SCENARIOS FOR VIETNAM’S TEXTILE AND GARMENT INDUSTRY: A GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSIS OF GREEN GROWTH AND GLOBAL TECHNOLOGIES TO ENHANCE COMPETITIVENESS
5. Key Agents in the Economy:
Households: Consumers make decisions on spending and saving based on income,
preferences, and prices.
Firms: Producers decide how much to produce based on costs, prices, and available
technologies.
Government: The model captures government activities, including taxation, spending,
and subsidies.
Rest of the World: It simulates international trade, investment, and capital flows,
showing how domestic economies interact with global markets.
Why It Matters: This enables policymakers to assess distributional impacts, such as how
changes in taxes, subsidies, or trade policies will affect different households, industries,
and regions. It is especially useful for equity and inclusion analysis.
6. Key Data Inputs:
The model uses large datasets, such as input-output tables (which show the flow of goods
and services between sectors), trade data, labor market statistics, and national accounts.
Why It Matters: High-quality data ensures that the model’s results reflect real-world
economic conditions and provide realistic forecasts, making it a reliable tool for
evidence-based policy design.
Applications for Policymakers
1.	 Policy Impact Analysis:
•	Policymakers can simulate the economic impacts of policy proposals, such as tax
reforms, energy policies, trade agreements, or labor market regulations. The model
shows how these policies affect GDP, employment, inflation, income distribution, and
sectoral output.
2.	 Trade and Globalization:
•	A multi-region CGE model helps evaluate the effects of trade policies, tariffs, and
trade agreements (e.g., free trade zones, tariffs) on both domestic and international
economies. It provides insights into how different countries or regions will be impacted
by changes in trade flows and global supply chains.
3.	 Environmental and Climate Policies:
•	By incorporating environmental data, the model can assess the effects of carbon
pricing, emissions reductions, or renewable energy transitions. It helps estimate the
economic cost of environmental policies and identifies opportunities for sustainable
growth while mitigating adverse impacts on industries and workers.
4.	 Technological Change and Innovation:
•	Policymakers can use the model to analyze how technological advancements (e.g.,
automation, digitalization) will affect labor markets, productivity, and industrial
competitiveness. It highlights the sectors likely to benefit or suffer and suggests policy
responses to support vulnerable industries or regions.
5.	 Investment and Infrastructure Planning:
•	The recursive dynamic feature allows for long-term analysis of infrastructure
investments (e.g., transport, energy, digital infrastructure) by showing how they
stimulate growth, productivity, and job creation over time.
6.	 Income Distribution and Equity:
•	CGE models can be used to study the distributional effects of policies. For example,
policymakers can assess how tax reforms or social policies (like healthcare or
education subsidies) impact different income groups or regions.

SCENARIOS FOR VIETNAM’S TEXTILE AND GARMENT INDUSTRY: A GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSIS
OF GREEN GROWTH AND GLOBAL TECHNOLOGIES TO ENHANCE COMPETITIVENESS
4.1.1 Baseline Scenario
We project the global economy from 2014 to 2045 under a baseline scenario (see Box 2) aligned
with Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2 (SSP2), which incorporates forecasts for real GDP and
population growth through 2045 (Fricko et al., 2017). Labor supply is assumed to grow in line with
population trends. In each region, real GDP projections are achieved by adjusting primary-factor-
augmenting technological change to match the anticipated GDP levels.
In addition, we integrate projections for productivity and efficiency improvements in the crop,
livestock, fishery, and food processing sectors, based on estimates from Hatfield-Dodds et al.
(2017). Global emissions forecasts are derived from the International Energy Agency’s World
Energy Outlook 2023 (IEA, 2021), which predicts that global emissions could peak at 56.5 billion
tons of CO2-equivalent (CO2e) annually by 2030, declining to 51.5 billion tons by 2050. Projections
for individual greenhouse gases (such as CO2 and CH4) are accounted for by endogenizing global
emission intensity for each gas. We also assume a uniform 1% annual improvement in energy
efficiency across all sectors and households worldwide. For Vietnam, GDP and export forecasts to
key trading partners including China, India, the USA, Canada, the UK, Australia, Japan, and the
ROK are based on estimates from the General Statistics Office of Vietnam, covering the period
from 2014 to 2023.

4.1.2 Green Growth and Technological Development Scenarios
We design the green growth and technological development scenarios around four key pathways:
low green–low tech, low green–high tech, high green–low tech, and high green–high tech. These
scenarios examine how varying rates of green growth and technological advancements in Vietnam’s
textile and garment industries will impact the sectors and their supply chains.
In all scenarios, only the Vietnam textile and garment industries experience differentiated shocks,
while shocks for the global textile and garment industries remain unchanged with the values shown
in Table 2. We assume global energy efficiency improves at a rate of 3% per year from 2024 to
2030, as estimated by the International Energy Agency3, with a slower growth rate of 2.5% per year
between 2031 and 2037, and 2% per year from 2037 to 2045 following business cycles. These
assumptions align with the Solow growth model, which predicts decreasing annual energy
efficiency gains over time. The same growth pattern is assumed for chemical use and the recycling
of water and materials. For annual labor productivity growth in the textile and garment industries,
we follow estimates from (El Achkar Hilal et al., 2022).

Note: In all green growth and technological development scenarios, the common shocks for world’s textile and garment industries
are implemented. In other words, there are only differences in shock values for Vietnam’s textile and garment industries if not
specified, for example, in Scenario S12.
Table 3 outlines four primary scenarios focused on Vietnam’s textile and garment industries. In the
first scenario (S1: low green–low tech), these industries achieve only 1% annual growth in green
growth indicators, which is lower than the growth observed in international markets. In this
scenario, we assume that labor productivity growth rates in Vietnam’s textile and garment sectors
remain on par with those of the international market. In the second scenario (S2: low green–high
tech), Vietnam is assumed to achieve labor productivity growth rates two percentage points higher
per year than those in the global market. Similarly, in the third (S3: high green–low tech) and
fourth scenarios (S4: high green–high tech), we assume improvements in green growth indicators
and technological development in Vietnam’s textile and garment industries that exceed the
respective growth rates in international markets. The major differences in growth rates in Vietnam
compared to the rates in the international market over scenarios S1-S4 are to show clear impact
differences across scenarios. Over experiments in selections of growth rates, these are the rates
giving clear signals in showing the impacts of factors on the growth and competitiveness of the
textile and garment industry in Vietnam.

4.2 Result Analysis
In general, productivity improvements in a specific factor make it more efficient and cost-effective
to use, enhancing the performance of sectors that rely on that factor, as well as the broader economy.
Related supply chains also benefit from cheaper inputs, further boosting sectoral performance.
However, whether a sector grows or experiences a decline in output depends on its competitiveness
relative to similar sectors in other markets. For instance, if textile and garment industries in markets
outside Vietnam perform significantly better and offer lower product prices, Vietnam’s textile and
garment sector may struggle to expand production and may even need to reduce output. Nonetheless,
the negative impact would be less severe than in the absence of productivity improvements. It is
also noted that baseline values and changes relative to these baselines for each scenario are
provided in Appendix 3.
4.2.1 Primary Scenarios
The future of Vietnam’s textile and garment industry can be shaped by various approaches to green
growth and technological advancement. To explore this, we have identified four key scenarios that
represent different combinations of environmental sustainability and productivity improvements.
These scenarios range from minimal advancements in both areas to full integration of cutting-edge
technology and green practices. Each scenario presents distinct opportunities and challenges for
the industry, outlining potential paths for Vietnam to remain competitive while addressing global
market demands for efficiency, sustainability, and innovation.
NATIONAL STRATEGY TO BOOST VIETNAM’S TEXTILE AND GARMENT PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY | 63
SCENARIOS FOR VIETNAM’S TEXTILE AND GARMENT INDUSTRY: A GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSIS
OF GREEN GROWTH AND GLOBAL TECHNOLOGIES TO ENHANCE COMPETITIVENESS
4.2.1.1 Scenario 1 Slow and Steady (Low Green – Low Tech)
This scenario reflects a gradual, conservative approach with minimal advancements in both green
growth and technology. The industry’s focus remains on maintaining current practices without
significant investment in sustainability or technological improvements. In terms of green growth,
there are only slight improvements in energy efficiency, chemical usage, water consumption, and
the use of recycled materials. These changes are incremental and do not involve any major
overhauls in environmental practices. For technology and productivity, labor productivity in both
the textile and garment sectors remains at baseline levels, meaning there is little to no progress in
adopting new technologies or improving efficiency.
Opportunities in this scenario include the benefit of lower initial investments for adopting green
technology, as businesses do not need to commit significant resources to drastic changes.
Additionally, stable, incremental improvements in both efficiency and labor productivity could
still provide small gains over time without the risks associated with rapid transformation.
However, the challenges are substantial. The industry risks falling behind international standards
on sustainability and innovation, which are becoming increasingly important in global markets.
Additionally, this approach limits Vietnam’s ability to meet growing global demand for sustainable
and efficient production processes, ultimately affecting its competitiveness on the world stage.
Conditions for the scenario to occur
Risks
• 	Cost-benefit focus: Government and industry
prioritize cost-saving over green and
technological investments.
• 	Stable market demand: International markets
continue to accept Vietnam’s production at its
current environmental and technological levels.
• 	Incremental industry changes: A slow,
conservative approach to improvements,
focusing on maintaining current productivity
and environmental impact without pushing for
radical change.
• 	Market access: Growing global emphasis on
sustainability could result in a lack of access to
eco-conscious markets/buyers.
• 	Environmental costs: Over time, the lack of
green practices may lead to higher operational
costs due to resource inefficiencies (e.g., water,
chemicals).
• 	Reputation damage: Limited focus on
environmental impact could harm Vietnam’s
reputation with global brands and consumers.
4.2.1.2 Scenario 2: Tech Driven (Low Green – High Tech)
This scenario centers on leveraging technological advancements to enhance productivity while
maintaining minimal improvements in environmental sustainability. The industry prioritizes
efficiency and productivity through technology, often at the expense of green initiatives. Regarding
green growth, this scenario sees minimal improvements in environmental practices and initiatives.
The emphasis is primarily on technological solutions rather than adopting sustainable practices. In
terms of technology and productivity, there are significant enhancements in labor productivity
across both the textile and garment sectors. The integration of advanced technologies enables
companies to optimize operations and achieve higher output levels, leading to increased
competitiveness in global markets.
64 | NATIONAL STRATEGY TO BOOST VIETNAM’S TEXTILE AND GARMENT PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY
SCENARIOS FOR VIETNAM’S TEXTILE AND GARMENT INDUSTRY: A GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSIS OF GREEN GROWTH AND GLOBAL TECHNOLOGIES TO ENHANCE COMPETITIVENESS
The opportunities presented by this scenario include the potential for higher labor productivity,
which can significantly enhance a company’s competitiveness on the international stage.
Additionally, businesses can increase their production capacity and output without making
substantial changes to their environmental practices, allowing for short-term gains in efficiency.
However, the challenges are noteworthy. The focus on low green growth may lead to regulatory
hurdles and reputation issues, especially in sustainability-focused markets where consumers and
brands are increasingly demanding eco-friendly practices. Furthermore, the long-term
environmental inefficiencies and resource usage associated with minimal green initiatives could
hinder future growth and viability in a market that is progressively leaning towards sustainability.
Conditions for the scenario to occur
Risks
• 	Advanced automation: Strong focus on
improving productivity through technology
adoption, including automation, AI, and
robotics.
• 	Labor productivity initiatives: Workforce training
and technology integration lead to improved
labor productivity, offsetting the lack of green
initiatives.
• 	Global demand for efficiency: Continued
demand for efficient, low-cost production rather
than purely sustainable practices.
• 	Market access: Growing global emphasis on
sustainability could result in a lack of access to
eco-conscious markets.
• 	Environmental costs: Over time, the lack of
green practices may lead to higher operational
costs due to resource inefficiencies (e.g., water,
chemicals).
• 	Reputation damage: Limited focus on
environmental impact could harm Vietnam’s
reputation with global brands and consumers.
4.2.1.3 Scenario 3: Green Driven (High Green – Low Tech)
This scenario emphasizes a strong commitment to environmental sustainability while making only
moderate advancements in labor productivity. The textile and garment industries in this context
focus on improving ecological outcomes rather than technological innovation. In terms of green
growth, this scenario showcases significant improvements in areas such as energy efficiency,
chemical usage, water conservation, and the utilization of recycled materials. Companies adopt
robust sustainability practices, striving to minimize their environmental impact and align with
global standards for eco-friendliness. However, when it comes to technology and productivity,
labor productivity remains at baseline levels. The industry does not prioritize technological
upgrades, which may limit overall productivity gains. This reliance on established practices may
hinder companies’ ability to maximize efficiency fully.
The opportunities within this scenario are compelling. Companies that achieve strong
environmental credentials can access new market segments increasingly focused on sustainability.
By improving resource efficiency, businesses can also reduce long-term operational costs, further
enhancing their profitability. Nonetheless, there are challenges that accompany this scenario. The
slower growth in productivity may result in higher production costs, which can limit the
competitiveness of firms in the global market. Additionally, the capacity to scale up production in
response to increasing demand may be constrained, as the focus on green practices could restrict
rapid expansion and adaptation to market changes.

4.2.1.4 Scenario 4: Sustainable Innovation (High Green – High Tech)
This scenario represents a synergistic approach, combining high levels of green growth with
cutting-edge technological advancements. The objective is to achieve global competitiveness by
prioritizing both sustainability and operational efficiency. In terms of green growth, this scenario
is characterized by significant improvements in energy efficiency, chemical usage, water
conservation, and the utilization of recycled materials. Companies in this scenario are committed
to meeting and exceeding environmental standards, establishing themselves as leaders in sustainable
practices within the textile and garment industry. On the technology and productivity front, there
are strong improvements in labor productivity across both textiles and garments. The integration
of innovative technologies enhances production capabilities, allowing businesses to operate more
efficiently and effectively while maintaining their environmental commitments.
The opportunities presented in this scenario are substantial. The combination of high green growth
and productivity improvements positions companies for long-term sustainability and
competitiveness in the global market. Furthermore, businesses can meet the increasing
environmental standards demanded by consumers and brands, making them attractive partners for
eco-conscious organizations. This scenario fosters innovation leadership, as companies that invest
in sustainable practices can appeal to global brands focused on sustainable production. However,
the scenario also poses challenges. The high initial and ongoing investments required for both
green growth and technological upgrades can strain financial resources, particularly for smaller
enterprises. Additionally, managing the transition to a sustainable and high-tech model requires
careful planning and execution to keep costs under control while implementing significant changes.
Balancing these investments and the management of the transition is crucial for success in this
competitive landscape.

4.2.2. Decomposition of Impacts (Scenarios A0-A6)
This section breaks down the individual impact of various factors affecting Vietnam’s textile and
garment industries, comparing deviations from the baseline across Scenarios A0-A6.
benefits from increased global productivity excluding Vietnam within the textile and garment
industries, driven by green growth and technological advancements. As a result, Vietnam’s real
GDP steadily rises from 2025 to 2045, reaching a 7.21% increase in 2045 relative to the baseline.
This is primarily due to the improved efficiency and reduced costs in global textile and garment
production, which positively impact Vietnam’s supply chains. Although Vietnam’s textile and
garment industries do not experience direct productivity growth, the country still benefits from
more cost-effective global supply chains.
In Scenarios A1-A5, where individual indicators improve by 1% annually (see Table 4.4), the
impacts on Vietnam’s real GDP vary. In Scenario A3, the impact on real GDP mirrors that of A0,
suggesting that efficiency gains from reusing water and recycling materials in Vietnam’s textile
and garment industries are not significant drivers of economic growth. Similarly, Scenario A4
shows that substituting vegetable oil for chemicals in these industries does not notably boost
Vietnam’s economy.
In Scenario A2, improvements in chemical usage lead to modest gains in economic performance,
with real GDP increasing by 0.07 percentage points in 2030 and 0.12 percentage points in 2045
compared to A0. However, the largest GDP growth is observed in Scenarios A1 and A5, where
improvements in energy efficiency and labor productivity within Vietnam’s textile and garment
industries drive the most substantial gains. For instance, by 2045, real GDP is 0.25 percentage
points higher compared to A0.
Scenario A6 combines the effects of all improvements from A1-A5, demonstrating that these
combined advancements would boost Vietnam’s real GDP by 0.61 percentage points in 2045
compared to A0. This highlights that energy efficiency and labor productivity improvements are
the most critical factors in driving Vietnam’s economic growth in this sector. NATIONAL STRATEGY TO BOOST VIETNAM’S TEXTILE AND GARMENT PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY | 67

IMPACT ON VIETNAM’S REAL GDP ACROSS SCENARIOS (% DEVIATIONS FROM THE BASELINE)
Scenario A0
Table 6 illustrates that the impact on the performance of Vietnam’s textile and garment industries,
measured by output levels, follows a different trajectory compared to the effect on Vietnam’s real
GDP. In Scenario A0, where productivity improvements occur in the textile and garment industries
of other countries but not in Vietnam, Vietnam’s industries experience a significant loss of
competitiveness, leading to substantial output reductions. Specifically, Vietnam’s textile output
declines by 6% in 2025, worsening to a 57% reduction by 2045 compared to the baseline. Similarly,
the output level of Vietnam’s garment industry decreases by 5% in 2025, reaching a 52% decline
by 2045.
These declines are driven by productivity improvements in textile and garment industries in other
markets (see Table 4.2), making their production more efficient and cost-effective. As a result,
their products become cheaper, enhancing their competitiveness relative to Vietnam’s textile and
garment sectors.

Table 6 reveals that, unlike the impact on Vietnam’s real GDP, energy efficiency improvements in
Vietnam’s textile and garment industries have minimal effects on their output levels, as shown by
the small differences between Scenario A1 and A0. This is because energy efficiency improvements
primarily benefit the supply chains linked to these industries rather than directly enhancing the
industries themselves. Consequently, while the output levels of these sectors see little change, the
positive impacts on Vietnam’s overall GDP are more pronounced.
Among all scenarios, improving labor productivity in these industries (Scenario A5) has the most
favorable impact on their output levels. As labor-intensive sectors, enhancements in labor
productivity lead to better performance, reflected in smaller declines in output levels. For instance,
the textile sector shows a reduced negative impact of -54%, while the garment sector experiences
a -47% decrease, making this the most effective intervention for boosting sector performance.
4.2.3 Result Analysis of Vietnam’s Textile and Garment Industries in Green Growth and
Technological Development Scenarios (Scenarios S1-S12)
Figure 27 illustrates the impacts on the output levels of Vietnam’s textile and garment industries
across Scenarios S1-S12. In Scenario S1 (low green–low tech), where Vietnam’s labor productivity
grows at the same rate as other countries, but green growth indicators remain significantly below
global levels, the output of Vietnam’s textile industry sees only modest growth for a few years,
peaking by 2028. Afterward, the output begins to decline, reaching a 34% reduction by 2045
compared to the baseline. The garment industry follows a similar trend, with output growth peaking
in 2035 at a 3.6% increase relative to the baseline, but gradually falling to a 22% reduction by 2045.
In Scenario S2 (low green – high tech), when labor productivity in Vietnam’s textile and garment
industries improves at a higher rate than in international markets, the performance of these sectors,
as measured by output levels, also improves significantly. Specifically, the output level of Vietnam’s
textile industry gradually increases, reaching 4.8% above the baseline by 2030, while the garment
industry sees a more substantial improvement of 13.2% by 2036. However, these years mark the
peak growth rates for both industries. Following this peak, they begin to lose competitiveness and
cannot sustain their growth, resulting in output declines of 26% for textiles and 10% for garments
by 2045 compared to the baseline.
In Scenario S3 (high green – low tech), while green growth indicators in Vietnam surpass international
levels, labor productivity remains aligned with global standards. This leads to similar impact
patterns on output levels as observed in S2. When both green growth indicators and labor productivity
improve at higher rates relative to international levels in Scenario S4 (high green – high tech), the
textile and garment industries can only sustain output growth for a limited time 2032 for textiles,
reaching a 13.2% increase, and 2037 for garments, approaching a 26.9% increase before
experiencing declines and diminished competitiveness. The results from Scenarios S1-S4 suggest
that even when productivity and efficiency in Vietnam’s textile and garment industries exceed those
in other markets (as in S4), these sectors cannot maintain competitiveness beyond a decade due to
the more efficient production and lower costs in other countries.
In Scenarios S5 and S6, although labor productivity in Vietnam’s textile and garment industries
improves at higher rates, it results in only slight performance enhancements, yielding peak growth
rates in the mid-2030s and reduced negative impacts in 2045 compared to the baseline. Notably,
while the garment industry still shows positive growth in 2045, the textile industry faces a
significant output reduction of 16-18% in S5 and S6 compared to the baseline.

When capital productivity growth is introduced in Scenarios S7-S9, both industries experience
improved performance. For example, the output level of Vietnam’s textile industry increases
gradually to a peak of 22-29% above the baseline by 2035, declining by only 6.4-1.5% in 2045
compared to the baseline. With a 7% annual increase in capital productivity, the textile industry
still manages a positive output growth of 0.9% in 2045 relative to the baseline. However, the
results from Scenarios S7-S9 indicate that even significant improvements in capital productivity
cannot sustain growth in these industries beyond 2035, resulting in continued long-term
competitiveness losses.
In Scenario S10, where total factor productivity grows at 1% per annum to substitute for labor and
capital productivity growth, the performance of Vietnam’s textile and garment industries improves
significantly. For instance, the output level of the textile industry increases by 17.6% in 2036 and
9.1% in 2045 compared to the baseline, while the garment industry sees gradual output growth
from 2024-2045, reaching a remarkable 135% increase by 2045. However, even with a 1% annual
increase in total factor productivity, the textile industry still experiences declining output growth
trends from 2037-2045.
In Scenario S11, with an increase in total factor productivity to 2% from 2037-2045 instead of 1%,
the textile industry no longer shows declining trends, with output levels growing steadily from
2024-2045 and reaching 39.4% above the baseline by 2045. In Scenario S12, when all other
markets also experience total factor productivity improvements of 0.5% per annum, Vietnam’s
textile and garment industries continue to experience gradual output growth from 2024-2045. In
fact, these sectors exhibit higher growth rates compared to Scenario S11, with the textile industry
increasing its output by 20% in 2030, 29% in 2035, and 48% in 2045 compared to the baseline. The
garment industry shows even greater growth rates of 66% in 2030, 130% in 2035, and 225% in
2045. This indicates that a 0.5% improvement in total factor productivity in international markets
does not equate to the improvements of other factors shown in Table 2, which ultimately diminishes
the competitiveness of international textile and garment industries compared to their Vietnamese
counterparts. Figure 28 illustrates the impacts on the export levels of Vietnam’s textile and garment
industries across Scenarios S1-S12.

4.2.4 Result Analysis of Vietnam’s Textile and Garment Industries’ Key Supply Chains in
Green Growth and Technological Development Scenarios
Figure 29 illustrates the impact of fiber imports by Vietnam from its primary trading partners. In
the baseline scenario, fiber from Africa, the USA, and Latin America become relatively inexpensive
compared to those from other markets, leading most countries, including Vietnam, to significantly
increase their import demands for fiber from these regions. Specifically, in the baseline, Vietnam’s
imports of fibers from Africa, the USA, and Latin America rise from USD1,432 million, USD1,810
million, and USD757 million in 2030 to USD3,436 million, USD3,584 million, and USD1,558
million in 2045 (see Table 3.5 in Appendix 3). In contrast, imports of fiber from India see only a
modest increase, rising from USD634 million in 2030 to USD651 million in 2045.
Consequently, in the green growth and technological development scenarios, the relatively cheaper
fibers from Africa, the USA, and Latin America continue to dominate exports to Vietnam,
effectively substituting for the more expensive fibers from India. This results in substantial
increases in imports of fibers from Africa, the USA, and Latin America, while imports from India
decrease. Notably, the imports of fibers from Africa to Vietnam experience the highest growth rates
across scenarios, driven by strong growth in the textile and garment industries in the USA and
Latin America, which create high domestic demand for fibers, with most of Africa’s fibers
production directed toward exports.
In particular, Vietnam reduces its imports of fibers from India by 16-26% in 2030 and by 60-73%
in 2045 across various scenarios compared to the baseline. In contrast, the demand for fibers from
Africa increases significantly, with growth rates of 12-22% in 2030 and 26-39% in 2045
across scenarios.

The demand for chemicals is influenced by generic productivity improvements in chemical
utilization, resulting in an overall decline in the demand for chemicals per output unit in the textile
and garment industries. However, this decline also depends on the relative price changes between
trading partners. Specifically, the results indicate that chemical outputs from countries such as
China, Germany, the USA, Indonesia, and the UK decrease across scenarios due to their higher
prices compared to other markets. This reduction in chemical output shifts the supply curve
backward, leading to increased chemical prices in these regions relative to others.
As a consequence, Vietnam’s demand for importing chemicals from China, Germany, the USA,
Indonesia, and the UK declines significantly, with a reduction of 50% expected in 2030 and 75%
in 2045 across scenarios. This decline is partially offset by increased imports of chemicals from
other markets, such as India (approximately 40% in 2030 and 250% in 2045), Japan (65% in 2030
and 300% in 2045), the ROK (80% in 2030 and 245% in 2045), Thailand (80% in 2030 and 300%
in 2045), and the Middle East (70% in 2030 and 100% in 2045) (see Figure 30).

The previous results indicate that textile output levels in Vietnam increase at relatively low rates
compared to other countries, with declining trends in output levels after several years and/or a
decade across most scenarios. Consequently, textile prices in Vietnam tend to be higher than those
in other nations. However, the overall economy of Vietnam benefits from improved productivity,
which enhances household well-being. As a result, Vietnam’s demand for textiles from foreign
markets rises to meet domestic needs.

Figure 31 illustrates that demand for Japanese textiles in Vietnam experiences the highest growth
rates compared to textiles from other markets such as China, Turkiye, Indonesia, the ROK, and
Thailand. This surge is attributed to significant productivity improvements in Japan’s textile
industry, which are projected to boost the sector to grow by approximately 70% in 2030 and over
300% by 2045. This boost in productivity reduces the supply price of textiles in Japan, thereby
attracting demand from other countries, including Vietnam. For instance, Vietnam’s demand for
textiles from Japan is expected to increase by 75-260% in 2030 and by six to 14 times in 2045
relative to the baseline.
Imports of textiles from other countries also rise at relatively high rates, although not as dramatically
as the demand for Japanese textiles, primarily due to changes in relative prices. Additionally,
demand for textiles from India is projected to decline by 14% in 2030 and by 22% in 2045 compared
to the baseline, largely due to the lower prices of textiles from other markets, which supply as
substitutions for Indian textile.

S12 Vietnam’s demand for imported apparel also undergoes changes, though it experiences lower
growth rates compared to the demand for imported textiles. This is primarily because the apparel
sector in Vietnam develops relatively well across various scenarios, as previously indicated.
Consequently, the expansion of the apparel sector partially satisfies domestic demand, which is
driven by a wealthier economy characterized by increased GDP and income. As a result, the
increase in demand from international markets is less pronounced.

S12 4.2.5 Analysis of Macro Impacts on the Economy of Vietnam
Vietnam is poised for higher economic growth due to more efficient and cost-effective production
resulting from productivity improvements. These enhancements benefit the entire supply chain of
the textile and apparel industries by reducing input costs, which in turn fosters growth in related
sectors, propelling the Vietnamese economy to develop at an accelerated pace.
Table 7 illustrates that Vietnam could achieve a real GDP growth of USD24-65 billion by 2030 and
USD113-277 billion by 2045 compared to the baseline. These figures represent significant gains
contributing to the overall development of the Vietnamese economy. Scenario S12 indicates the
highest increases in real GDP, driven by substantial productivity improvements, while Scenario S1
shows the lowest growth increases due to relatively minimal advancements in green growth and
technological development indicators. The results in other scenarios also align with this trend,
where real GDP increases correspond with the magnitude of productivity improvements in
each scenario.

4.3 Discussions and Summary
The global economy, including Vietnam, is expected to benefit from strong real GDP growth due
to productivity improvements in the textile and garment industries. These sectors not only become
more cost-effective and efficient but also help reduce production costs across their entire supply
chains, enhancing the productivity of other industries. This leads to substantial economic growth,
especially in countries like Vietnam, where the textile and garment industries significantly
contribute to the GDP and employ a large portion of the workforce.

SCENARIOS FOR VIETNAM’S TEXTILE AND GARMENT INDUSTRY: A GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSIS
OF GREEN GROWTH AND GLOBAL TECHNOLOGIES TO ENHANCE COMPETITIVENESS
This report analyzes the impact of various green growth and technological development scenarios
on Vietnam’s economy, with a focus on the textile and garment industries. We utilize a recursive
dynamic computable general equilibrium model (GTEM), widely used for policy and technological
development analysis, including in studies like the Australian National Outlook and Global
Resources Outlook, which assess the effects of sustainability pathways on global and national
economies as well as major manufacturing and service sectors (Hatfield-Dodds et al., 2017; Lu et
al., 2024; Nong et al., 2023).
The scenarios are designed to identify key factors influencing Vietnam’s textile and garment
industries and explore strategies to maintain their global competitiveness. Analysis of scenarios
(A0-A6) reveals that while some factors, such as improving chemical utilization efficiency, water
recycling, and substituting chemicals with vegetable oils, yield relatively small economic gains,
they offer significant environmental benefits. These inputs make up a smaller portion of the textile
and garment production process, leading to positive environmental impacts rather than strong
economic ones. Energy efficiency improvements also benefit Vietnam’s broader economy but have
a limited direct impact on textile and garment production unless energy efficiency improvements
are substantial, as these industries are not energy-intensive.
Labor productivity improvements, however, are key to boosting the performance of Vietnam’s
textile and garment sectors, which are labor-intensive and currently have low productivity.
Enhancing labor productivity would significantly benefit these sectors in Vietnam. However, this
growth can only be sustained for up to a decade, after which the industries face declining
competitiveness. Even though productivity in Vietnam’s textile and garment industries may grow
faster than in other countries, they struggle to compete globally after the mid-2030s. Similarly,
improvements in capital efficiency do not significantly alter the trend, as output levels begin to
decline after a decade.
The only factor that sustains growth in Vietnam’s textile and garment industries through 2045 is an
increase in TFP. However, to maintain output growth, particularly in the textile industry, TFP
growth must accelerate after a decade. Without at least a 1% annual increase in TFP, the textile
industry’s output will decline, whereas the garment industry can remain competitive and achieve
strong growth with just a 1% improvement per annum.
Overall, the findings indicate that Vietnam’s textile industry, in general, shows lower competitiveness
compared to its garment industry, which demonstrates greater resilience and faster output growth.
The garment industry experiences less severe declines and higher output increases, even under the
same productivity improvement rates. Furthermore, labor productivity is a crucial factor for the
short- and medium-term development of these sectors, but improvements alone are insufficient to
ensure global competitiveness, particularly after the mid-2030s. Similarly, capital productivity
does not provide long-term competitiveness. TFP, however, proves to be a more effective driver of
growth for Vietnam’s textile and garment industries. TFP will need to accelerate in the long term,
especially for the textile sector, to maintain global competitiveness. Finally, while green growth
indicators primarily benefit the environment, they also help these sectors meet the increasing
demand for environmentally friendly products in Western markets, but they offer low cost-
effectiveness in production processes.
78 | NATIONAL STRATEGY TO BOOST VIETNAM’S TEXTILE AND GARMENT PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY
The Vietnamese textile and garment industry stands at a critical juncture, shaped by an array of
megatrends that are redefining its landscape. Sustainability and circular fashion, geopolitical trade
shifts, digitalization and Industry 4.0, textile innovation, and the evolving dynamics of skilled
labor are significant forces driving change. As businesses and policymakers respond to these
megatrends, they must embrace innovative strategies to ensure long-term success and resilience.
Within this dynamic landscape, Sustainable Innovation (High Green – High Tech) emerges as
a critical pathway for businesses and policymakers. This scenario envisions a future marked by
substantial green growth and technological advancements, aimed at enhancing global
competitiveness through sustainability and efficiency. By leveraging these megatrends and aligning
with this direction, stakeholders can navigate the complexities of the industry while capitalizing on
emerging opportunities.
We propose specific recommendations tailored to address the challenges and opportunities within
the industry, focusing on actionable steps for both businesses and policymakers in each scenario.
5.1 Scenario 1: Slow and Steady (Low Green – Low Tech)
Under this scenario, the Vietnamese textile and garment industry focuses on incremental changes
with minimal advancements in sustainability and technology. Recommendations focus on
supporting the Vietnamese textile and garment industry in making incremental, low-risk
improvements in sustainability and operational efficiency, with minimal technological advancement.
By providing accessible financial incentives, targeted training and workforce development, and
foundational sustainability practices, these recommendations enable gradual adoption of eco-
friendly and productivity-enhancing measures. This approach helps policymakers, industry
associations, and firms build a foundation for future growth without imposing significant financial
burdens, thereby fostering a resilient, cohesive industry prepared for eventual shifts toward greener
and more efficient practices.
Financial incentives
Policymakers:
•	 Develop low-interest loans and small grants aimed at incremental improvements in energy
efficiency, such as LED lighting and basic HVAC upgrades. These financial supports ensure
that SMEs, which may lack substantial capital, can make small-scale improvements without
significant financial strain. This approach allows for gradual adaptation to eco-friendly
practices without the financial risks associated with larger overhauls.
•	 Metrics: Number of SMEs adopting energy-efficient upgrades, initial energy savings, and
reported reductions in utility costs.
Industry associations:
•	 Advocate for pooled funding and micro-grants that encourage small firms to share
resources for minor technological enhancements and green practices. Collective funding
initiatives can help SMEs lower individual costs and share access to basic sustainable
infrastructure. This will build industry-wide cohesion and allow for shared learning and
gradual scaling.
NATIONAL STRATEGY TO BOOST VIETNAM’S TEXTILE AND GARMENT PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY | 79
•	 Metrics: Participation in pooled funding programs, the number of joint projects funded, and
improved efficiency metrics.
Training and workforce development
Policymakers:
•	 Partner with local vocational schools and training centers to create courses focused on
energy management and basic operational efficiency. Basic training programs provide
workers with foundational skills that yield immediate operational improvements without
heavy investments. This establishes a baseline for workforce readiness that can support
future transitions to more advanced practices.
•	 Metrics: Enrollment rates, course completion rates, and productivity improvements
post-training.
Industry associations:
•	 Conduct workshops on 5S and Lean basics to help firms streamline operations and reduce
waste. Introducing simple productivity-enhancing practices ensures that member firms can
make meaningful changes without major technological investments. This helps standardize
practices across the industry, improving overall efficiency.
•	 Metrics: Workshop attendance and participant feedback, measured adoption of Lean practices.
Firms:
•	 Implement basic Lean training programs for workers to increase process efficiency and
reduce waste. Lean practices offer quick wins in productivity with minimal initial investment,
allowing firms to see cost reductions. This will build operational discipline that prepares
firms for more significant future changes.
•	 Metrics: Reduction in waste and energy use, improvements in throughput.
Sustainability and green transition
Policymakers:
•	 Introduce and enforce minimal regulations focusing on energy management and basic waste
reduction. These regulations encourage adherence to simple sustainability practices without

Appendix 1: Methodology for interviews
The interview process was designed to gather insights into the megatrends influencing Vietnam’s
textile and garment industry.  The interviews followed an open-ended, conversational format.
While a set of core questions was prepared, the discussions allowed flexibility for participants to
explore topics in more depth. Each interview lasted approximately 45 - 60 minutes. Participants
were asked for consent to record the conversation, with all information treated confidentially. No
personal attributions were made in the final report, ensuring that all responses were anonymized.
Nine interviews were conducted with high-level executives from various textile companies and
industry associations in Vietnam, ensuring that the findings reflected a wide spectrum of expertise
and industry roles (Table 1).
Interviewees were first asked to describe their organizations, including key products, markets, and
their roles within the companies. This established the context for their responses and provided
insights into their expertise related to the textile and garment industry. The core of the interview
focused on identifying and discussing significant trends shaping the industry. Open-ended questions
encouraged interviewees to share their perspectives on various topics related to megatrends and
their impact on Vietnam’s textile and garment industry. The interviews captured a broad range of
opinions and experiences, which were used to identify key challenges and opportunities for the
future of Vietnam’s textile and garment industry.

Appendix 2: GTEM model and database
This study employs the Global Trade and Environment Model (GTEM) – a recursive dynamic,
multi-country, and multi-region computable general equilibrium (CGE) framework developed by
the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) – to analyze economic
activities (Nong et al., 2023, Lu et al., 2024). The GTEM model is grounded in neoclassical
economic theory, where rational agents operate in markets to maximize utility (for consumers) and
profits (for firms) subject to income and input constraints.
In GTEM, productive sectors such as services and manufacturing require inputs to generate
outputs. Some inputs, like labor or raw materials, are essential and cannot be substituted, meaning
reductions in their use directly reduce output. Others, such as coal and gas, are substitutable. For
instance, when the price of coal rises, industries may opt to use more gas to reduce production
costs. The model’s production structure reflects these dynamics, grouping substitutable inputs to
capture such behavior. Substitution occurs at various levels, where inputs (e.g., A1, A2, ... An and
X1, X2, ... Xn) can be substituted for one another if they serve similar functions. Substitution rules,
governed by elasticity parameters, determine how industries switch between inputs, such as
shifting from coal to gas when the price differential reaches a certain threshold.
On the demand side, GTEM models consumer preferences for goods and services. Some consumers
exhibit flexibility, substituting similar goods like T-shirts and collared shirts based on price and
income. In contrast, preferences may be more specific in certain contexts, such as a preference for
T-shirts over collared shirts for sports activities. The model simulates demand using a representative
consumer, with demand functions that allow for varying levels of substitution between similar
goods or commodities. These functions incorporate substitution mechanisms to account for changes
in price or income. Common substitution functions include the constant elasticity of substitution
(CES), Leontief, constant ratios of elasticity of substitution–homothetic (CRESH), and constant
difference of elasticities (CDE).
In GTEM, various technologies are represented, including 15 electricity generation methods (e.g.,
coal, gas, solar, wind, hydroelectric), five land transportation technologies (ranging from
conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to hybrids and non-fossil alternatives),
two iron-steel manufacturing technologies, and specialized sectors such as ruminant meat and fish
processing.
Figures 2.1 and 2.2 illustrate the production structure in GTEM. At the top level, input demand is
split into two components: an assembly service and a technology bundle. These components are
combined using a Leontief function, meaning they are not substitutable. The assembly service
aggregates intermediate inputs through a Leontief function, a common feature in CGE models
(Hertel, 1997). The technology bundle, on the other hand, comprises specific inputs unique to each
technology. For example, coal-fired and nuclear electricity generation rely on distinct inputs,
which are substitutable through a CRESH function (Pant, 2007, Cai et al., 2015).
Each technology is characterized by a specific set of intermediate inputs with no substitution
allowed between them, as represented by the Leontief function. For example, coal-fired electricity
relies on coal and coal-specific inputs, while gas-fired electricity depends on natural gas and gas-
specific inputs. The primary factors of production, such as labor and capital, are combined using a
CES function, allowing for a degree of substitutability among them.

PRODUCTION STRUCTURE OF A ‘TECHNOLOGY BUNDLE’ INDUSTRY
Note: The technology bundle sectors are electricity generation, land transportation, iron & steel manufacturing, ruminant meat
processing, and fish processing. The supply of technology-specific inputs to the ‘technology bundle’ industries follow
the mechanism applied for all other sectors (i.e., ‘non-technology bundle’ industries). When a technology-specific input
is allocated to a ‘technology bundle’ industry, it cannot be substituted for other inputs or the same type of inputs from
other sectors. In other words, we only differentiate the demand for inputs.

The production structure for industries outside the ‘technology’ and ‘processing’ bundles in GTEM,
as shown in Figure 2.2, includes sectors such as mining, manufacturing, agriculture, food
processing, and services. These industries employ production technologies that optimize input
selection using various functional forms, with the goal of minimizing production costs. NATIONAL STRATEGY TO BOOST VIETNAM’S TEXTILE AND GARMENT PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY | 99

Conditional Frontier Model
A model that assesses an industry’s performance relative to its most efficient firms, considering
existing barriers such as limited technology access or capital. This conditional frontier represents
the maximum productivity achievable under these constraints.
Energy Efficiency
A measure of the amount of energy used relative to the output produced. In the textile and garment
industry, it reflects how effectively energy is utilized in production, impacting both sustainability
and cost.
Frontier Model
A model that determines the relative efficiency of similar decision-making units (DMUs) by
comparing their input-output performance against a best-practice frontier. This frontier represents
the optimal input-output combinations, allowing for efficiency comparisons across DMUs.
Labor Productivity
The ratio of total output per hour worked. It measures how efficiently labor input is combined with
other production factors to generate output. In the textile and garment sector, labor productivity
indicates workforce utilization efficiency and competitiveness.
Technical Efficiency
The ability to either reduce input quantities proportionally without affecting output (input-oriented)
or increase output proportionally without changing input quantities (output-oriented) to achieve
cost, revenue, or profit efficiency within a system.
Total Factor Productivity (TFP)
TFP reflects the overall efficiency with which labor and capital inputs are used together in the
production process. Changes in TFP indicate effects from improved management practices,
branding, organizational changes, knowledge, network effects, spillovers from production factors,
adjustment costs, economies of scale, imperfect competition, and measurement errors.
Unconditional Frontier Model
A model that estimates industry productivity if all barriers to technology and capital were removed,
reflecting the highest efficiency achievable without current constraints.
