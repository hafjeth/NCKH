In recent years, there are many textile and garment enterprises in Vietnam who are
interested in understanding the relevance of ESG practices to their business
performance. The article is researched with the aim of analyzing the relationship
between ESG practice and the performance of businesses, especially in the textile and
garment industry in Vietnam. The authors used Cronbach's Alpha accreditation,
EFA factor analysis, linear regression model, and Bootstrap testing for intermediate
variables to analyze "The impact of ESG practices on the performance of textile
enterprises in the period 2018 - 2021". The results showed a positive influence
between ESG practices and business performance through factors such as customer
loyalty, corporate reputation and corporate culture. Keywords: ESG, Environmental, Social, Corporate governance, Business

core value in the operation of businesses, especially focusing on issues related to employees, communities ... The
company has a pioneering board of directors and management to apply regulations on ESG disclosure, integrate
ESG into the strategic plan to increase operational efficiency, better manage risks, and bring value to shareholders
and increase the resilience of the business in the context of today's volatile world. In Vietnam, the textile and garment industry is on track to reduce resource use and pollution, strengthen worker
protection and protect the interests of customers. Vietnam's textile and garment industry in recent years is still RESEARCH REVIEW International Journal of Multidisciplinary Vol.08 | No.03 | March 2023 https://rrjournals.com/ 43
making efforts to realize green production goals and reduce emissions to contribute to the implementation of the
Government's commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 at the 26th UN Conference of the Parties on Climate
Change. In the future, the sustainable development of this industry depends entirely on the use of resources,
related to water, soil and oil, and recycling products to reduce waste. That requires the textile industry to operate
on the practice of ESG criteria. Recognizing the above situation as well as to meet the mentioned goals, in this research paper, the authors study
the impact of ESG practice on the performance of textile and garment enterprises in Vietnam. The authors chose to
use intermediary factors: customer loyalty, corporate reputation, corporate culture and corporate size to consider
the impact of ESG practices on the performance of Vietnamese textile and garment enterprises. On that basis, we
propose a number of suitable solution recommendations for textile and garment enterprises in particular and
enterprises operating in Vietnam in general. Research overview and theoretical basis Research overview
There are a number of studies that have been done on how ESG affects or influences factors in the business as a
whole. Their findings are different from research methods and research in different aspects of the business's
operations. Around the world, many researchers have conducted research on the relationship between ESG and business.
Weber's (2013) study analyzed the reporting of the top 100 Chinese companies on the green environment,
resulting in good ESG reporting that provided better financial returns and improved corporate environment
efficiency. Clark, Feiner and Viehs (2015) studied more than 200 books and newspapers on ESG and found that
more than 90% of businesses with deep ESG adoption minimize capital costs, 88% of ESG enterprises see an
improvement in operational efficiency, and 80% of research indicates that:  the adoption of ESG has a positive
effect on stock prices. In addition, factors such as human and social rights as well as production responsibilities
have also shown a positive relationship with the rate of return on capital efficiency (Chen, Feldmann and Tang,
2015). Ali Fatemi, Martin Glaum, Stefanie Kaiser. (2017) studied the relationship between performance and company
values, they found that the strengths of ESG increase company value and weaknesses reduce that value. Almeyda
and Darmansyah's (2019) study resulted in a significantly positive relationship between ESG disclosure and
company performance, which demonstrated that ESG information transparency can improve financial
performance. In addition, numerous studies show that corporate governance outcomes are positively related to
the organization's financial performance, and ESG reporting contributes to better financial performance and is
important in assessing corporate value (Duque-Grisales and Aguilera-Caracue, 2019). ESG ratings can also be suitable for integration into policy standards and financial analysis. Ganlin Pu (2022)
assessed the non-linearity between ESG activities and the company's performance in the case of emerging markets,
namely China. The findings from the analysis of 232 listed Chinese companies show a positive association between
ESG activities and company performance, however, the relationship is non-linear. Rupamanjari Sinha Ray (2022)
empirically investigates the impact of ESG scores on financial variables that can affect the performance of
companies in the Indian context. The results show the fact that ESG scores are an emerging indicator for forming
future risk mitigation and financial performance strategies and, therefore, are of considerable importance from a
policy perspective. There are also a number of recent studies that have argued in favor of no relationship between
ESG activities and corporate performance (Friede et al., 2015; Shakil et al., 2019). In Vietnam, Thi Thuy Phung in ESG research with sustainable development of Vietnamese enterprises gives
research results that ESG indicators evaluate and rank the sustainable development of enterprises. In particular, RESEARCH REVIEW International Journal of Multidisciplinary Vol.08 | No.03 | March 2023 https://rrjournals.com/ 44
ESG indicators and reports of enterprises are very important, are the basis for the selection of financial investors,
business partners and are a competitive tool of enterprises in the market to meet customer expectations in
modern society. Although there have been many studies related to ESG and enterprises in the world, none have delved into the
impact of ESG practices on the performance of enterprises in Vietnam, especially textile enterprises. Meanwhile,
the textile and garment industry in Vietnam is increasingly generating many different types of goods, which means
an increase in the amount of waste discharged into the environment, and ESG practice is extremely necessary for
the operation of these textile enterprises. Theoretical basis
Institutional theory:
Institutional Theory analyzes the role of institutionalization, as well as the role of meaningful institutions shaping
the behavior of individuals and businesses in ESG practice. Chatterji and Toffel (2010) explained the impact of ESG
ratings on improving environmental performance. Jayachandran et al. (2013) demonstrated the impact of social
activism on corporate performance. In addition, Almeyda and Darmansyah's (2019) study results in a significantly
positive relationship between ESG disclosure and corporate performance, which in turn encourages investors,
corporate governance, and industry regulators to consider the importance of ESG disclosure. In general, based on
institutional theory, corporate ESG practices actually have an impact on a company's performance in many
respects. Stakeholder theory:
The Stakeholder Theory was published by Freeman (1983). This theory deals with organizational governance and
business ethics. Drawing on stakeholder theory, Muller and Kräussl (2011) studied the relationship between
corporate charitable donations and return on investment. Kölbel et al. (2017) studied the relationship between
corporate social irresponsibility and financial risk. It can be seen that, based on the theory of stakeholders, research
on the influence of ESG practices in businesses suggests that businesses that better meet the ESG requirements of
their stakeholders will perform more effectively than irresponsible businesses. Research hypothesis
From the basis of the above theory, research hypotheses are formulated and selected as follows: The relationship between your ESG practices and your performance
Guido Giese, et (2019) studies and suggests that there is a positive association between ESG information and the
valuation and performance of companies. Harvard Business School (2015) also points out that businesses that
perform well on ESG tend to have higher profitability and higher valuations than competitors that do not perform
well on ESG. There is a lot of research on ESG affecting many aspects of business performance, so the authors
make the first hypothesis along with the expectation of a positive relationship between ESG and business
performance. H1: There is a direct and positive relationship between ESG and business performance. The relationship between ESG practice and customer loyalty
A study by Cone Communications (2017) found that 87% of customers will buy products from businesses that
perform well on ESG, and 76% will share information about these products with friends and family. Research by
Accenture (2018) has also shown that most customers (62%) in the US, UK and Canada are willing to pay more for
products and services of businesses that perform well on ESG, with 80% of consumers saying they are more likely
to choose an environmentally sustainable brand. This indicates a change in the customer's perception of the RESEARCH REVIEW International Journal of Multidisciplinary Vol.08 | No.03 | March 2023 https://rrjournals.com/ 45
environmental strategy of the business. These studies all use intermediary variables to increase customer loyalty,
increase sales to confirm that ESG has a positive impact on customers. The authors therefore hypothesize that:
H2: There is a positive relationship between ESG and customer loyalty. The relationship between customer loyalty and business performance
Competition between businesses is generally about customers, namely customer loyalty. When customers are loyal
to the services or products of the business, it not only improves the operational efficiency of the business but also
cuts advertising costs and attracts customers. Seaide et al. (2015) conducted research and showed a positive
relationship between customer loyalty and the financial performance of the business. From there, the authors
proposed the research hypothesis:
H3: There is a positive relationship between customer loyalty and business performance. The relationship of ESG practice to the reputation of the business
Reputation is an extremely valuable intangible asset of a business. It is reputation that is the tool that creates the
competitive advantage of businesses. Harvard Business School (HBS) mentioned reputation when it comes to ESG:
This study analyzed more than 2,000 businesses between 1992 and 2010 and demonstrated that businesses with
better levels of ESG performance tend to have better reputations in the eyes of customers, investors and
community. ESG and corporate reputation are closely related, so the authors hypothesized that:
H4: There is a positive relationship between ESG practice and the reputation of the business The relationship between the reputation of the business and the performance of the enterprise
Several studies have established a positive relationship between a business's reputation and performance. Robert
and Dowling (2002) found that companies with relatively good reputations are likely to remain highly profitable
over time. Tan (2007) points out that reputation is directly proportional to the sales of the business. And
Khojastehpour and Johns (2014) – one of the first research papers to highlight the positive impact of environmental
CSR on brand reputation has an impact on business profitability. From there, the authors have the following
hypothesis:
H5: There is a positive relationship between the reputation of the business and the performance of the business The relationship between ESG practice and corporate culture
Morgan Stanley's "ESG and Corporate Culture" (2021) surveys how ESG impacts corporate culture, especially in
terms of corporate values, vision, and motto. PwC's "The Role of the Board'' (2019) outlines the board's role in
promoting and building a positive corporate culture and how to evaluate and manage ESG elements of business
operations. Swiss Finance Institute (2018) focuses on studying the link between ESG and corporate culture in the
banking industry and banks evaluate and manage these factors to enhance trustworthiness. From that connection
combined with factors in ESG the authors propose the hypothesis:
H6: There is a positive relationship between ESG practice and corporate culture The relationship between corporate culture and corporate performance
Shahzad et al. (2012) assert that organizational culture has a profound impact on the diversity of organizational
processes, its employees, and its performance. Mashal Ahmed & Saima Shafiq (2014) research shows that Hofstede
cultural aspects influence organizational performance in telecommunications companies. A study by Kotter and
Heskett (1992) of U.S. businesses also found a positive relationship between corporate culture and corporate
performance. Researchers have found that businesses with a culture that is long-term oriented, customer- and
employee-focused, and puts customer value first perform better than businesses without a similar culture. From
the links between corporate culture and corporate efficiency, the authors propose hypotheses:
H7: There is a positive relationship between corporate culture and corporate performance
The relationship between ESG practice and business size RESEARCH REVIEW International Journal of Multidisciplinary Vol.08 | No.03 | March 2023 https://rrjournals.com/ 46
Research on the relationship between ESG and business size focuses on whether ESG practices affect business size.
Harjoto and Jo (2011): Research focused on defining the relationship between ESG and company size. Businesses
that practice ESG well can attract customers and investors to help grow revenue and scale operations. In addition,
ESG practices can also help strengthen the financial viability of businesses, making them able to meet the needs of
expansion and development. On this basis, the authors proposed the hypothesis:
H8: There is a positive relationship between ESG practice and business size The relationship between business size and business efficiency
Business size is one of the factors that affects business value and has a positive impact on the profitability of the
business (Ni Nyoman G Martini Putul, 2014). Research by Dr. Heikki Juslin (2013) at the University of Oulu, Finland
surveyed 1,743 small and medium-sized enterprises in Finland, the results showed that business size has a strong
correlation with operational efficiency, but this correlation varies depending on the type of industry and
geographical location of the business. Dr. Satish Kumar and Dr. Senthil Kumar (2017) at Anna University, India's
research results suggest that enterprise size has a significant impact on its operational efficiency and that large
enterprises tend to have better operational performance due to their financial strength and ability to invest in
research and development. From the assertions of previous studies, the authors propose the hypothesis: H9: There is a positive relationship between business size and business efficiency
The formal research model and research hypotheses are presented in Figure 1. Research Methodology Data collection
Figure 1: Proposed research model Source: Proposed study authors The authors used research data including both secondary and primary data. Through previous domestic and foreign studies along with the preliminary investigation of a group of research
subjects and experts in the field, the authors have come up with a research model consisting of 8 large factors and
49 observational variables used as a scale for the parent factors. Primary data is collected by online and offline survey methods for textile enterprises across the country. Data processing RESEARCH REVIEW International Journal of Multidisciplinary Vol.08 | No.03 | March 2023 https://rrjournals.com/ 47
With the model used as multivariate linear regression with intermediate or regulatory variables, the authors used
data analysis software SPSS version 20.0 with Cronbach's Alpha tools, EFA factor analysis, multivariate regression
model analysis and Bootstrap test for intermediate variables to assess the influence of multipliers. to dependent
variables. The tool to measure is a 5-degree Likert scale that denotes the impact of ESG practice on business
performance. Research results and discussions General description
The study conducted online and offline surveys for textile and garment enterprises operating in Vietnam obtained
302 survey samples, of which 268 were valid and put into data processing by SPSS software version 20.0. The report on "ESG practice readiness in Vietnam in 2022, shows that 80% of businesses have committed or plan to
commit to ESG in the next 2-4 years. This shows that ESG practice is something that businesses need to focus on
and implement in the coming time if businesses want to stand firm in the market and compete compared to other
businesses, especially in risk management, attracting customers and investors. Scale reliability testing
The Cronbach's Alpha test does not remove any observed variables because Cronbach's Alpha is greater than or
equal to 0.6 and the total variable correlation coefficient is greater than 0.3. The observed variables are suitable for
analyzing the next step. Table 1: Cronbach's Alpha accreditation results

The scales of independent and intermediate variables are both satisfactory, capable of convergence and good
representation of observed variables. The performance-dependent variable scale (7 observed variables) has all
converged to a column representing a single dependent variable of the study model. RESEARCH REVIEW International Journal of Multidisciplinary Vol.08 | No.03 | March 2023 https://rrjournals.com/ 48 Linear regression analysis
Linear regression analysis according to the Enter method with 3 independent variables: ESG_E, ESG_S, ESG_G and

Source: Extract from SPSS 20.0 The regression equation with a normalized Beta coefficient looks like this:
HQ =  0.278*ESG_E + 0.373*ESG_S + 0.357*ESG_G The regression result yielded a corrected 𝑅2 value of 0.738 meaning that 73.8% of the variation of the HQ variable
was explained by 3 independent variables ESG_E, ESG_S. The model had no correlated phenomena (DW = 1.512)
and multilinear (VIF < 2). At the same time, the T-test Sig value of the 6 factors < 0.05 means that the factors
included in the model are consistent and statistically significant with a significance of 5%. Specifically, the influence of factors is arranged according to the degree of decreasing of the standardized β
coefficient as follows: ESG implementation policies on Society (β = 0.373); ESG implementation policies on
Governance (β = 0.357); and finally, the impact of environmental policies (β = 0.278). Thus, Social ESG is the factor
that most affects business performance. Therefore, business administrators need to pay attention to the good
implementation of policies related to society and community in parallel with the implementation of policies related
to the environment and corporate governance. Test F in the ANOVA table will check whether this linear regression model is broad and applicable to the whole. Table 4: ANOVA

respectively; 0.8494; 0.2507; 0.7037 sig tests of ESG variables are less than 0.05 indicating that the relationship
between ESG variables and KH, DT, VH, QM is statistically significant. ESG practices have a positive impact on
customer loyalty, corporate reputation, corporate culture, and corporate size. RESEARCH REVIEW International Journal of Multidisciplinary Vol.08 | No.03 | March 2023 https://rrjournals.com/ 49
Thus, Hypothesis H2, H4, H6, H8 is supported at a meaningful level of 5%. Multiple regression results:

indicating that the relationship between the variables KH, DT, VH and HQ is statistically significant, the
unnormalized beta coefficient of KH, DT, VH is equal to 0.6422, respectively; 0.1146; 0.1338 shows that Customer
Loyalty, Corporate Reputation and Corporate Culture have a positive impact on business performance. Only ESG, QM → HQ variables: The test sig of QM variable equal to 0.5079 is greater than 0.05 indicating that the
relationship between QM and HQ variables is not statistically significant, the unnormalized beta of QM equal to

corporate culture serve as intermediaries in the relationship between ESG practice and operational performance.
There is a confidence interval QM variable of [-0.0360; 0.0739] containing a value of 0. The Enterprise Size variable
does not act as an intermediate variable in the relationship between ESG practice variables and operational
efficiency. Conclusions and proposals Conclusions
The research results of the article point to a positive relationship between ESG practice and corporate performance
through the role of corporate values: customer loyalty, corporate reputation, corporate culture. It mentions the
same relationship of ESG practice to corporate reputation, customer loyalty, corporate culture, and assesses that
these three factors all have a positive impact on business performance. Thus, it can be seen that practicing ESG,
building customer loyalty, reputation and good corporate culture will lead to innovation in a positive way and
thereby increase operational efficiency in each enterprise, especially for Vietnamese textile and garment
enterprises. Recommendations
Based on the views made and analyzed on ESG above, our research paper offers some suggestions for businesses
on ESG implementation as follows: Firstly, businesses need to be properly aware of ESG as well as the importance and necessity of ESG in the current
trend of globalization and international integration to be able to participate in the global supply chain and for the
goal of operating effectively towards sustainable development. Secondly, enterprises need to arrange and improve the capacity of specialized personnel in ESG, focusing on and
improving production management skills, value chain management and customers; develop and effectively RESEARCH REVIEW International Journal of Multidisciplinary Vol.08 | No.03 | March 2023 https://rrjournals.com/ 50
implement the Program to support human resource development in the textile and garment sector, focusing on
new and necessary skills in the context of the industrial revolution 4.0. Thirdly, develop and publish the company's regulations and policies on ESG annually. At the same time, it is
necessary to amend and supplement policies in a timely manner so that they are reasonable to environmental and
social circumstances and fully promote the positive impact of ESG on economic consequences.
Fourth, businesses need to make efforts to transform themselves, catch up with market trends, invest in
technology machinery, green transformation to adapt to the requirements of brands, and strengthen many
solutions for development. Fifth, it is necessary to attract foreign investment selectively, giving priority to investment projects in advanced
textile and dyeing technology, without causing adverse impacts on the environment. Sixth, connecting with domestic garment enterprises, forming a link chain throughout the value chain, offering
scientific and technological solutions to green the textile industry... aiming for sustainable development, while
meeting the requirements of major markets in the world. References [1.] Ali Fatemi, M. Glaum, Stefanie Kaiser. (2017). ESG performance and firm value: The moderating role of disclosure.
