environmental damage. Therefore, "greening" for sustainable development of the textile and apparel industry is becoming a trend,
a call from customers around the world. When customers have strict requirements, requiring garment products to meet
"sustainable" criteria, garment exporting companies in Vietnam cope with challenges. The article analyzes the advantages and
challenges of garment export companies in Vietnam when participating in the global supply chain in the current green context.
Recommendations are then proposed for garment export companies, the Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association and the
Government to develop the sustainable textile and apparel supply chain, facilating garment export companies to improve their
capacity when participating in the chain.

Vietnam has signed 17 bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) so far and is currently negotiating two more trade
agreements (WTO center, 2024). In the context of such international integration, countries and businesses have become
increasingly interdependent in global trade. Thanks to these agreements, textiles and garments, and other products have
benefited from tariff incentives to boost export growth. Currently, the textile and garment industry is one of Vietnam’s key industries with exports reaching over 100 countries and
territories (International Trade Center  [Intracen], 2024) with the high export turnover is accounting for 12–16% of the country’s
total export turnover (Vietnam textile & apparel association [VITAS], 2024). In the structure of textile and garment exports, apparel
products hold a significant share of the industry’s total export turnover. As a result, the supply chain of garment export companies
(GECs) has received considerable attention from various stakeholders, including the Vietnam government, VITAS, and businesses. Moreover, with the growing trend of environmental protection linked to socio-economic development, major textile and
garment importing markets of Vietnam have gradually set regulations to make a green textile and garment supply chain. This
requires GECs to focus on environmental aspects such as green production processes and green product development in order to
become priority partners for major manufacturers and distributors. Conversely, if they fail to meet the green trend, they will
gradually lose their market share. Aziz Khan et al. (2024) demonstrated that market pressure and the rise of competitors in
garment manufacturing drive businesses to implement environmentally friendly export strategies. According to the authors' literature review, there are currently some research worldwide on the drivers and barriers of green
textile supply chain such as Diabat et al. (2014), Gardas et al. (2018), and Caniato et al. (2015) and Aziz Khan et al. (2024). Studies
in Vietnam related to the textile and garment supply chain have been carried out but in general, there are still few official studies
about the textile industry or GECs on sustainable development linked to environmental concerns. Existing research on the
industry's environmental aspects primarily evaluates the impact of various factors on the green transformation of enterprises
(Binh & Trang, 2021; Linh & Binh, 2024); however, there is a lack of studies on the current sustainability of the supply chain and
solutions for developing a sustainable supply chain for GECs. As the requirements for "greening," environmental considerations
and sustainability in the textile and garment industry are no longer just trends but essential requirements, GECs must continuously
seek solutions to develop appropriate strategies that meet importing markets' demands to participate more deeply and
sustainably in the global textile and garment supply chain. This study aims to fill that gap. Sustainable Development of Textile and Apparel Supply Chain for Garment Exporting Companies in Vietnam in the

II. LITERATURE REVIEW A. Supply chain
LaLonde and Masters (1994) define a supply chain as a network of businesses involved in the physical movement of goods from
transporting raw materials and products to delivering them to the final consumers. Typically, multiple independent enterprises
within the chain contribute to bringing products to customers, including raw material suppliers, manufacturers, wholesale and
retail customers, and transportation companies. Following the same perspective, Lambert et al. (1998) define a supply chain as
the collaboration of businesses to bring products and services to the market. Similarly, Mentzer et al. (2001) describe a supply
chain as a network of at least three companies, where at least one company is directly connected to another in the forward or
backward flow of products, services, information, or finances toward the customer.
Thus, a supply chain can be understood as a network that links upstream suppliers and downstream customers through
processes and activities that create value for the products and services provided to customers in the market.
B. Sustainable supply chain
Sustainable Development
According to the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) of the United Nations, sustainable development
is defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet
their own needs. Sustainable development must be based on three pillars: economic, social, and environmental, with none of
these aspects being overlooked. Specifically, it involves: Further promoting economic development, ensuring ecological
sustainability, achieving social equity by creating a more balanced distribution of opportunities to utilize natural resources.
Sustainable development is not merely a trend but a necessity for business growth (Zejjari & Benhayoun, 2024).
Sustainable Supply Chain
According to Carter and Rogers (2008), a sustainable supply chain is one that integrates an organization's social, environmental,
and economic objectives into the coordination of business processes. This ensures the effective management of raw materials,
information, and financial flows related to procurement, production, and distribution of products or services to meet stakeholder
demands. The supply chain must fully incorporate transparency, ethics, and environmental responsibility into a competitive model
that drives success. In general, a sustainable supply chain refers to the integration of economic, social, and environmental practices
into supply chain management. It must always be closely linked to environmental protection.
C. Supply chain of GECs in Vietnam
The textile and apparel supply chain is unique in that it is entirely influenced by buyers. To produce a finished product, raw
materials must go through multiple production stages which are often carried out in different countries. The apparel supply chain
consists of five fundamental stages: branding / design / sourcing (raw materials) / manufacturing (cutting-sewing-processing) /
distrubution (Goto, 2011). This classification also highlights the textile industry's role as the primary supplier of raw materials for
the apparel industry, specifically through the sourcing stage in apparel manufacturing enterprises. GECs adopt different approaches to entering the supply chain. Based on the stages they undertake within their operations,
production-export methods can be classified into four main categories (Figure 1): CMT (Cutting - Making - Trimming) method:
This is the most basic production method for entering the fashion market. The buyer provides raw materials along with product
specifications, while the garment manufacturer is responsible for cutting, sewing, and processing the product. OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturing) or FOB (Free on Board) method:
In this approach, the manufacturer takes on greater responsibility, including sourcing and negotiating with suppliers for raw
materials, financing material purchases, and handling production as per customer requirements. The final products are then
packed and delivered to the buyer as agreed. In some cases, the foreign buyers may designate specific material suppliers, but the
garment enterprises remains fully responsible for all production activities and product completion. ODM (Original Design Manufacturing) method:
The ODM manufactures manage the entire process of producing finished garments, including design/ sourcing raw materials/
cutting, sewing, packaging/ and distribution. OBM (Own Brand Manufacturing) Method:
This method integrates the entire production process with brand creation, allowing enterprises to develop and market their own
branded products. Sustainable Development of Textile and Apparel Supply Chain for Garment Exporting Companies in Vietnam in the

The primary methodolody used in the study is the document analysis method. The author synthesizes, systematizes, and analyzes
secondary data collected from reports by VITAS, the Vietnam National Textile and Garment Group (Vinatex), the Vietnam General
Organization (ILO) on the textile and garment industry, along with other previously published studies from 2019 to 2024.
Additionally, it references theories from recent studies in Vietnam and other countries, sourced from Scopus.com and reputable
domestic journals. IV. THE CURRENT STATE OF VIETNAM'S GARMENT SUPPLY CHAIN
A. Advantages of GECs in participating in the global textile and garment supply chain
Currently, the textile and garment industry is receiving significant attention from the Vietnam government. At the end of 2022,
the government issued “the development strategy for Vietnam’s textile, garment, and footwear industry until 2030 with a vision
to 2035”. This strategy clearly emphasizes the perspective of developing fashion design capabilities, creating Vietnamese brands
to dominate both the domestic and export markets and developing in alignment with ecological environmental protection,
fulfilling social responsibilities and obligations, ensuring compatibility with sustainable development goals and international
commitments. (Government, 2022). Vietnam's textile and garment industry has a high export turnover. With advancements in science and technology, along with
the support of VITAS and the government, garment enterprises have improved productivity and production quality, enabling
exports to demanding and developed markets such as the UK, the US, Japan, and the EU. Currently, Vietnam's garment industry
heavily relies on foreign markets, with approximately 90% of its output dedicated to exports, while only 10% is consumed
domestically. In the total export turnover of the textile and garment sector, garment products account for over 80-85% while the
remaining 15-20% comes from the export of yarn, fabric, and accessories as Table 1 (Vietnam customs, 2023). The industry's
export turnover in recent years has reached impressive figures with the figure of 2024 at 44 billion USD (a 9.2% increase compared
to 2023) and aiming to reach 68-70 billion USD by 2030. Table. 1: Vietnam’s garment export turnover (2018-2023) Source: Compiled by the author from Vietnam customs (2024) and WTO center (2024) Total export turnover of textiles and

JEFMS, Volume 08 Issue 03 March 2025 www.ijefm.co.in Page 1607 The signing of new-generation FTAs has facilitated Vietnam’s textile and garment exports, notably the Vietnam-EU Free Trade
Agreement (EVFTA) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Under EVFTA regulations, apparel tariffs
gradually reduce to 0% when exported to the EU, provided that rules of origin are met. RCEP, with its more flexible rules of origin,
allows raw materials to be sourced from any contracting country provided that garments are produced in Vietnam. This helps
textile and garment exporters benefit from tariff reductions, enhancing competitiveness in ASEAN markets, as well as in China,
South Korea, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. Most raw materials for Vietnam’s garment exports are imported from China. Previously, garments exported to the high-
potential Japanese market had to prove that raw materials originated from ASEAN or Japan. With RCEP in place, raw materials
Vietnam’s largest export customers, continue to reduce their reliance on China and shift sourcing to other Asian countries, with
Vietnam being one of the top preferred choices (Aslam, 2019; Purwono et al., 2022) Political instability in Bangladesh has led to a decline in the production capacity of its textile and garment industry, the country's
most valuable sector, accounting for nearly 85% of its export revenue. This led to the increase in production lead time, delayed
shipments, hampered work environment, and not achieving the exporting rate (Papon et al. 2017). As a result, global importers
are losing confidence and may shift their orders to other countries to compensate for the shortfall. Additionally, Bangladesh will
face pressure to increase wages for textile workers, reducing its advantage of low labor costs. Consequently, Vietnam’s textile and
garment industry may benefit from this shift (Vietnam News, 2024) Vietnam’s garment industry contributes to reducing the unemployment rate and provides income-generating jobs for over 3
million workers. GECs are increasingly paying attention to corporate social responsibility (CSR) and worker welfare. Customers in
developed countries place great emphasis on human rights and the CSR practices of exporting companies. Specifically, European
and U.S. buyers often set out Codes of Conduct (COC) or their national standards for enterprises and only place orders after
evaluating whether GECs meet these requirements. To support businesses in the industry, VITAS continuously works to raise
awareness of CSR among enterprises. As a result, most GECs have labor unions that represent workers' voices and help prevent
and resolve conflicts between employees and businesses. Nearly all enterprises comply with the state-mandated minimum wage
regulations, ensure timely wage payments, provide employee benefits, and safeguard worker health. They do not engage in forced
labor or child labor. Additionally, workplace conditions, factories, walkways, cafeterias, and meal quality have been improved.
Some companies even provide worker housing (International labour organization [ILO], 2023).
B. Challenges of GECs when participating in the global textile and apparel supply chain
Besides the advantages that GECs enjoy when joining the current supply chain, they also encounter numerous obstacles to
achieving sustainable development. The added value of garments created within the supply chain of Vietnam’s GECs is low. The main reason is that most GECs
currently produce based on customer orders under two common models including CMT which accounts for 65%, and FOB which
accounts for 25%. The OBM model still exists but is very limited, mainly adopted by enterprises that have developed domestic
markets and sell under their own brands. As a result, the added value generated by the Vietnam garment industry remains low.
Consequently, like other countries in the region, Vietnam is positioned at the bottom of the global textile and apparel supply chain,
as it primarily undertakes the manufacturing stage (cutting and sewing) (Figure 2). Fig. 2. Stages of the production process

Sustainable Development of Textile and Apparel Supply Chain for Garment Exporting Companies in Vietnam in the
Current Green Context
JEFMS, Volume 08 Issue 03 March 2025 www.ijefm.co.in Page 1608 From a social perspective, although the CMT model sustains employment in Vietnam’s garment industry, its reliance on low-
cost labor limits long-term sustainability, profitability, and worker benefits. With a large number of CMT orders and limited orders
under higher-value production models (FOB, ODM),  the supply chain struggles to achieve sustainability because CMT has low
entry barriers, and its competitive advantage mainly relies on low-cost labor - a factor that will gradually diminish as wage levels
in the region equalize. Since CMT does not generate high profits for enterprises, the actual revenue earned remains low, making
it difficult to improve worker benefits and bonuses. The import market face challenges and declining orders. According to VITAS, Vietnam's textile and garment export turnover in
2023 decreased by 20% compared to 2022. Major export markets such as the U.S., EU, South Korea, Canada, and Japan all saw
declines. The main reasons include geopolitical conflicts that have led to increased interest rates and inflation, resulting in reduced
global consumer demand. Many countries are also concerned about rising unemployment rates. Customers now prioritize price
above all. Some U.S. brands are shifting orders, especially small ones, to geographically advantageous countries like those in
Central and North America (Reuter, 2024; Inverto, 2025). Origin requirements for preferential tariffs under FTAs shoule be met. To benefit from tariff advantages under FTAs,
Vietnamese garments must meet origin requirements. Most FTAs apply the "cut-and-sew" rule, meaning that garments made in
Vietnam qualify for preferential tariffs if the cutting and sewing processes occur in Vietnam. Similarly, under RCEP, Vietnam can
import fabric from anywhere, as long as the cutting and sewing take place domestically. However, stricter agreements such as
AJCEP (ASEAN-Japan), VJEPA (Vietnam-Japan), and EVFTA (EU-Vietnam) require materials to be sourced from within the
agreement’s member countries. The most stringent is CPTPP, which follows the "yarn forward" rule, requiring yarn production,
weaving fabric, dyeing, and cutting-sewing to occur within CPTPP countries for preferential tariffs to apply. Stricter human rights compliance in the supply chain is imposed. Major apparel import markets have introduced mandatory
regulations on human rights compliance. For example, the U.S. passed Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act and bans cotton from
Xinjiang due to concerns over forced labor. Any apparel entering the U.S. must not contain materials from Xinjiang unless proven
without forced labor (Jessie Yeung (2022). Currently, over 60% of fabric used in Vietnam’s garment industry is sourced from China,
making it difficult to verify whether raw materials originate from Xinjiang.
Corporate social responsibility (CSR) should be met. CSR criteria remain inconsistent among businesses. A socially responsible
enterprise must ensure fair wages, reasonable working hours, and legal employment contracts while complying with labor
regulations (as per ILO’s Better Work program). While some businesses actively uphold labor rights, many still see CSR as a burden
rather than an opportunity for long-term growth. Compliance with CSR requirements is often reactive, driven by customer
demands. Reports indicate that12% of surveyed factories fail to pay social insurance on time, 45% do not compensate for overtime
work properly, 66% exceed the maximum working hours permitted by law (ILO, 2023)
The "green" transformation has been a mandatory long-term trend. What was once a qualitative expectation is now being
quantified through specific regulations on textile waste, emissions, and sustainability standards. Foreign buyers increasingly favor
manufacturers with eco-friendly facilities, energy-efficient production, and minimal emissions (Centre for the Promotion of
Imports [CBI], 2021). For instance, the EU mandates that exported garments must use cotton, polyester blended with recycled
fibers, or repurposed textile waste, contribute to the creation of a circular economy for textiles (European Parliament, 2025) V. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ENHANCING THE COMPETITIVENESS OF VIETNAM’S APPAREL INDUSTRY
Alongside certain advantages, Vietnam’s textile and garment industry in general, and GECs in particular, will continue to face
numerous challenges in coming years. Based on an analysis and forecast of domestic and international conditions, this article
proposes several implications for GECs to participate sustainably in the supply chain.
A. For GECs
Enterprises need to increase the proportion of OEM, FOB, and ODM orders in their order structure and diversify their markets.
OEM and ODM production models create higher value compared to basic processing. The ODM model has enabled many
companies to grow into well-known and successful businesses, such as Việt Tiến, May 10, TNG, Phong Phú, Đông Xuân, Thái Tuấn,
An Phước, Phương Đông, and others. Vinatex PD&B, newly established in 2024, primarily focuses on developing FOB, ODM, and
OBM products for both export and domestic markets (Vinatex, 2024). Customers now tend to prefer suppliers with integrated
supply chains and comprehensive services that meet their needs quickly, conveniently, and accurately while providing added
value, rather than just basic processing factories. Therefore, GECs need to strengthen their expertise, gain experience in handling
orders, build relationships with suppliers, and confidently negotiate with buyers to secure more high-value orders, starting with
OEM. To transition to the ODM model, GECs must further enhance their capabilities by investing in workforce training in areas
such as marketing and product design. In addition to maintaining relationships with traditional customers, GECs should take Sustainable Development of Textile and Apparel Supply Chain for Garment Exporting Companies in Vietnam in the
Current Green Context
JEFMS, Volume 08 Issue 03 March 2025 www.ijefm.co.in Page 1609
advantage of domestic and international trade promotion programs organized by VITAS to connect with potential clients, promote
their companies, and explore new markets. GECs need to focus on digital transformation to enhance efficiency. Enterprises must first maintain strict control over
production processes, ensure product quality, adapt to fast delivery requirements, and minimize waste and production costs.
Given the current global economic challenges, with consumers in many countries reducing spending and prioritizing price,
businesses should invest in digital management, automate certain production lines, and improve worker skills. While the initial
investment may be a challenge, it will ultimately increase productivity and overall manufacturing efficiency in the long run. Business leaders need to change their mindset on CSR. Business leaders must recognize that implementing CSR is an internal
driving force and an ethical obligation for businesses. Therefore, they should actively seek to understand and seriously comply
with CSR requirements from customers. It is essential to acknowledge that responsible business practices may increase costs in
the short term but will bring significant long-term benefits. These include stronger collaboration with employees and customers,
meeting international buyer requirements, enhancing corporate reputation, expanding export market opportunities, and
improving the company’s position in the global value chain. Moreover, if businesses approach CSR with a reactive mindset - only
adjusting operations to pass customer audits or factory inspections - it can lead to unsafe working conditions and undermine
sustainable development efforts. Businesses need to prioritize sustainability. As the Vietnamese government has strongly committed to achieving net-zero
emissions by 2050 at the COP26 conference (Vietnam plus, 2023), the trend of greening the textile and garment industry is
becoming increasingly important for businesses to meet both current and future requirements. To integrate into a sustainable
global textile supply chain, alongside factors such as pricing, product quality, and delivery time, the "green" criterion is equally
crucial. To reduce carbon emissions and ensure compliance with international sustainability standards, obtaining green
certifications for exported goods is essential. One key solution is the installation of rooftop solar energy systems. For example,
Thanh Cong Textile Company in the Phu Hoa Industrial Park, Vinh Long Province, implemented a rooftop solar energy model that
generates approximately 48.5 million kwh of electricity, covering 66% of the company’s production energy needs and reducing
44,281 tons of CO₂ emissions, equivalent to planting over 2.6 million trees. Similarly, Saigon 3 Garment’s solar power system not
only helps the company cut long-term electricity costs and lower CO₂ emissions but also enhances its reputation and brand image
in the eyes of customers and business partners. A newly established company in 2024, Vinatex PD&B, has prioritized sustainability
from the outset. It is one of the pioneering enterprises to obtain the Gold Lotus green building Certification, aligning with its
strategy to contribute to Vietnam’s net-zero emissions goal. Additionally, GECs can build "green factories" through various initiatives. These include replacing fluorescent lights with high-
efficiency LED lights, upgrading or replacing energy-intensive equipment, and adopting new energy-saving technologies. Another
key measure is transitioning from coal-fired boilers in kitchen areas to electric boilers, which helps reduce CO₂ emissions.
Furthermore, businesses should implement an energy monitoring system in production to detect and address inefficiencies, such
as idle-running machines, steam leaks, or system malfunctions. These insights serve as a foundation for improving energy
efficiency across machinery and equipment. By obtaining global renewable energy certifications such as the International
Renewable Energy Certificate (I-REC), GECs can meet the strict sustainability standards required by major export markets like
Europe, the U.S., and Japan.
B. For the Government
Developing raw material sources in the supply chain to enhance localization. The government should collaborate with VITAS and
local authorities to research and develop raw material areas, strengthen the domestic supply chain, and address the long-standing
shortage of locally sourced materials. This aligns with the global trend of importers shifting from multi-country supply chains to
more centralized supply chains. Additionally, it will help meet strict origin-tracing standards. Without a domestic raw material
supply, Vietnam’s textile industry will remain dependent on imports, making it difficult to reduce costs, shorten production
timelines, meet origin requirements, and take full advantage of tariff reductions under FTAs that require fabric to be sourced from
Vietnam. The government should create mechanisms to attract both domestic and foreign investment in textile-related industries,
including fabric production, dyeing, fiber manufacturing, and textile accessories. This requires policies that support land allocation,
investment in industrial clusters for fiber, weaving, and dyeing, and the removal of barriers to investment in these sectors at the
local level. Prioritizing investment in sustainable raw materials. The government should focus on attracting investment in sustainable
fabric production, including recycled fabrics, bamboo fiber, mint fiber, and coffee grounds-based textiles. This is essential for
exporting apparel, particularly to comply with the EU’s carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM). Policies of credit support Sustainable Development of Textile and Apparel Supply Chain for Garment Exporting Companies in Vietnam in the
Current Green Context
JEFMS, Volume 08 Issue 03 March 2025 www.ijefm.co.in Page 1610
for green investments is crucial, as funding plays a significant role in the early stages of sustainable textile development. GECs that
implement green production strategies and meet environmental investment project criteria under the environmental protection
law should be granted priority access to green credit policies.
C. For the Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association (VITAS)
VITAS should guide and support GECs in formulating and adjusting their business strategies and production plans. It should also
provide trade promotion and export assistance tailored to each company's needs and capabilities while aligning with market
trends. VITAS should organize seminars to analyze customer demands regarding CSR and invite experts to assess the importance
of genuine CSR compliance in business operations. The association must actively update and proactively share CSR requirements
from different customers with businesses in the industry to ensure they are well-prepared when engaging with new clients. It is crucial to monitor trends in sustainable and green exports and promptly convey relevant information and guidance to
member enterprises. VITAS should facilitate connections between domestic enterprises and foreign-invested companies to
establish a more integrated supply chain and expand export markets. Additionally, the association should collaborate with
reputable international organizations to implement support programs for businesses in areas such as management, green
transition, and new technologies. VI. CONCLUSION AND LIMITATION
To achieve sustainable development and enhance participation in the global supply chain in line with the green economy trend,
GECs must first transition to higher-value production models such as OEM, ODM, and OBM. They should take advantage of
opportunities to promote their brand, expand customer networks, and diversify markets. Additionally, businesses must focus on
self-innovation by investing in workforce training, adopting digital technologies for production control to reduce costs and improve
efficiency, and implementing green production measures to conserve energy and reduce CO₂ emissions. Furthermore, government
support is essential in developing raw material areas and implementing favorable policies for green investment financing. Lastly,
but equally important, VITAS must provide timely information, guidance, and support regarding sustainable supply chains and
green-oriented policies to help businesses adapt effectively.
A limitation of this study is that it relies on secondary data analysis, statistics, and descriptive methods. In the future, the author
should conduct qualitative studies through in-depth interviews with GECs to ensure more reliable and comprehensive results.
