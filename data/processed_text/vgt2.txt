“ Message
for the
he year 2024 has reaffirmed the market’s
unpredictability While the first half of the year
showed slight improvement, it still carried the
challenging momentum of 2023. However, the second
half saw a sudden surge in orders to Vietnam, driven
by unexpected political upheavals in competing
countries.
In 2024, our predictions across three different
scenarios proved to be quite accurate. Through
monthly reviews and workshops, we made timely
and flexible adjustments aligned with market trends,
targeting high-potential areas while minimizing losses
caused by low pricing and weak demand. Thanks
to thorough preparation for various scenarios, we
exceeded our annual targets, achieving over 50%
growth an exceptional result given the market
challenges and persistently low demand.
The garment sector continued to be the Group’s
most vital resource, ensuring financial and labor
stability, with some strong enterprises achieving
growth rates exceeding 50% compared to 2023.
Despite continued challenges and operating below
cost, the yarn sector managed to reduce losses over
85% compared to 2023, marking initial progress in
finding its path in a new phase.
Market difficulties and competition have taught us
significant lessons, aligned with the five steadfast
principles and the resilient, courageous, innovative,
and united spirit fostered over the past three years:
Self-reliance and Internal Strength: Only by maximizing internal strength can we
stand firm and trust our system through the toughest challenges. We cannot rely
on external support to help the Group overcome difficulties.
Proactivity, Creativity, and Flexibility: The key to survival lies in constant adaptation
based on high-quality forecasting and following market and competitor trends.
Building High-Quality Human Resources: Developing a robust, multi-generational
workforce, particularly focusing on young talent. In the context of scarce skilled
labor, pooling and sharing high-quality human resources have helped address
challenges across the Group. Connections between member units have been
enhanced.
Accepting Challenges and Experimenting: Actively exploring new products,
applying advanced technologies, and seeking new markets.
Upholding Responsibility and Promoting Sustainability: Strengthening our image
as a responsible corporation focused on green textiles is essential. Meeting all
commitments ensures our position as a reliable partner in global supply chains.

MESSAGE OF CHAIRMAN OF BOD VINATEX  - ANNUAL REPORT 2024 
VIETNAM NATIONAL TEXTILE AND GARMENT GROUP - VINATEX | 9 The year 2025 marks a significant milestone for
the nation, including the 80th anniversary of its
founding, accompanied by the vision of entering
a “new era of national revival.” It is also a pivotal
year for Vinatex, celebrating its 30th anniversary
and the start of a new term for the Board of
Directors. The mission for 2025 is to define what
the “new era of Vinatex” means and how it can
rise to meet the expectations of the nation and
its people.
Vinatex’s new era can initially be defined as sustainable
development across four pillars: environment, society,
governance, and finance (ESGF). It envisions Vinatex
as a globally competitive player in textile and garment
supply
chains,
possessing
unique
competitive
strengths through innovative technologies and
distinctive products. It also embodies a corporate
culture that blends the humanitarian traditions of past
generations with modern, worker-focused practices.
Strategies for Vinatex to rise in the New Era:
Maximizing Internal Strengths
Leverage the potential of individual enterprises
to build a unified stronger Group. The Group’s
strategic vision must translate into concrete
actions at the enterprise level. Horizontal and
vertical integration within and outside the Group
is crucial for building Group competitiveness
in the new phase, serving as the foundation for
securing a high position in global supply chains.
Attracting
and
Effectively
Utilizing Talent
Develop
and
share
high-quality
human
resources across the Group, fostering collective
progress. Given the intense competition in the
labor market, attracting and retaining top talent
is vital.
Accelerating Digital
Transformation
Modernize
governance
adopting
best management practices and digital
transformation initiatives across all Group
enterprises.
Developing Niche Products
and Markets
Research and create distinctive, innovative
products
beyond
conventional
textiles,
establishing technological and market barriers
to protect the Group’s sustainability. Balance
highly competitive production areas with those
offering greater creative value.
Applying Automation and AI
Reduce
dependence
labor
through
automation and artificial intelligence, increasing
the productivity and value of individual workers
in the textile and garment sector to align with the
country’s economic progress.
Preserving Unity and
Modernizing Culture
Preserve
solidarity
and
mutual
support
traditions while fostering a modern corporate
culture that emphasizes innovation, talent
recognition, and calculated risk-taking.
The market will remain competitive, and the challenges
of 2025 will be no less than in previous years. Global
economic uncertainties and competitors’ recovery
after a turbulent year will lead to increased supply.
However, with the “unchanging” values Vinatex
has built, coupled with clear strategies and the
determination, self-reliance, and resilience of the
entire system, we confidently step into 2025 a year
that marks the beginning of a new journey where
Vinatex will rise alongside the nation in this new era.

enabling woven and knitted fabrics to penetrate international markets.

efficiency, optimizing personnel systems and applying technology in administration.
The establishment of the Human Resources Division reflects the Group's leadership's

operating model, excellent management personnel to implement advanced governance
strategies and a high quality workforce that meets high standards to execute business
operation effectively.

4. EVALUATION OF THE GROUP'S
he domestic economic situation
in 2024 showed greater vibrancy
compared to 2023, with full-year
GDP growth of 7.09%, exceeding the target
set by the National Assembly. Notably, the
GDP in the fourth quarter of 2024 achieved
a growth rate of 7.55% compared to the
same period, the highest since the fourth
quarter of 2018. The total import-export
turnover of goods in 2024 is estimated to
reach USD786.29 billion, an increase of
15.3% compared to the same period and
the highest level ever recorded. The textile
and garment industry also recovered in line
with market trends, with export turnover
reaching USD43.7 billion, an increase of
10.3% (equivalent to an increase of USD4
billion) compared to the previous year.
The year 2024 continued to affirm the
unpredictable nature of the market. While
the market in the first six months was
somewhat better, it still reflected the
prolonged difficulties of 2023. However,
in the last six months, orders to Vietnam
increased dramatically due to political
fluctuations in competing countries.
In 2024, both Vietnam textile and garment
industry and the Group exhibited more
positive compared to the 2023. The
recovery of Vietnam’s textile and garment
industry in 2024 did not stem from
improved global textile and garment
consumption demand but rather from a
certain shift of orders from other countries
to Vietnam, specifically from China (due
to the tightening of regulations on Forced
Labor Prevention by the US and EU), from
Bangladesh,
Myanmar,
and
Indonesia
due to recent socio-political instabilities,
especially in Bangladesh, combined with
the exchange rate advantage when the
VND depreciated by 5% against the USD
since the beginning of the year, while
the currencies of competing countries
remained
almost
unchanged
against
the USD. Although the market situation
showed
positive
signs,
challenges
remained,
with
businesses
receiving
orders but unit prices not improving and
limited access to large orders.
Under the direction of the Party Committee
and the BOD of the Group, the Board
of Management closely monitored the
market and introduced flexible solutions.
As a result, the Group completed the
plan assigned by the General Meeting
of Shareholders, and the entire system
maintained its core resources of labor and
customers, ensuring financial stability.
Consolidated Production and Business Results of the Group:
 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 - CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
42 | VIETNAM NATIONAL TEXTILE AND GARMENT GROUP  - VINATEX
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  - ANNUAL REPORT 2024 
VIETNAM NATIONAL TEXTILE AND GARMENT GROUP - VINATEX | 43
In 2024, Vinatex continued to ensure
employment
for
workers
enterprises Level 1 with an average income
of 10.15 million VND/person/month (an
increase of 8% compared to 2023) and
maintained the Tet bonus regime for
workers. This was a significant effort
because, with unit prices not improving
in 2024, only income equivalent to 2023
could be ensured, while the 2024 salary
level increased. Enterprises in the system
accepted reduced profits to maintain
stable income for workers and stabilize the
workforce.
It can be said that achieving the above
results in the context of slow and uneven
market growth in 2024 was due to the
flexibility and agility in forecasting and
management of the BOD and the Group’s
Board of Management, along with the
contributions and efforts of enterprises
and the entire staff and workers in the
entire Group system.
However, there were still limitations in
the 2024 operations due to subjective
reasons
such
as:
the
yarn
sector
not being truly effective, with many
businesses still incurring losses. The
yarn sector mainly produces traditional
items and does not adequately meet the
diverse demand for other synthetic yarns
in the market. Raw cotton prices were
heavily influenced by speculation and
logistics, leading to sudden fluctuations.
Falling cotton prices led to sharp declines
in yarn prices, but yarn price increases
mainly depended on demand and did
not increase simultaneously with cotton
price increases. The current scale of
the weaving sector is small and cannot
absorb all the output of the yarn sector to
extend the supply chain. Production costs
were not optimized due to limitations
in machinery, equipment, technology,
and production management capacity in
some units.
The garment sector had possitive profits
partly due to the shift of orders from
competing countries due to some policy
issues/extreme weather, which was only
a short-term factor and could not be
sustained in the long term. In terms of
investment, due to the Group’s specific
mechanism, there was no breakthrough in
resources, and the Group’s divestments in
units were not truly effective. In terms of
human resources, there is still a shortage
of senior and key personnel, and the
salary and bonus regime lacks specific
provisions, limiting the recruitment of
talent. In production, the proportion
of basic garment items remained high
throughout the system, with no shift to
special and high-tech items, leading to
strong price competition from countries
with low labor costs and many tariff
preferences. There were still risks due to
the lack of diversification in customer and
supplier.
5. OPERATING ORIENTATIONS OF THE BOD IN 2025
oward the end of 2024, major economic
institutions released optimistic forecasts for
global economic growth in 2025, reflecting
expectations
post-pandemic
recovery
and
monetary policy stabilization. Both the IMF and OECD
raised their global GDP growth forecasts to 3.3% for
2025 with expectation for declines in inflation and
interest rates. The U.S. economy was expected to
maintain a growth rate of 2.7%, driven by a strong labor
market recovery, stable consumption and increased
investment. Meanwhile, China projected a 4.7%
growth rate, supported by government-led economic
stimulus packages.
However, these forecasts were quickly revised
following Donald Trump’s return to the White House
in January 2025, accompanied by a series of new
supplementary and reciprocal tariffs imposed on over
180 economies. These measures reignited tensions in
U.S.–China trade relations, bringing the trade war back
to center stage and weakening market confidence.
The OECD downgraded the global growth forecast for
2025 to 3.1%, a 0.2 percentage point drop. Notably, the
U.S. growth forecast was revised down to 2.2% due to
 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 - CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
44 | VIETNAM NATIONAL TEXTILE AND GARMENT GROUP  - VINATEX
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  - ANNUAL REPORT 2024 
VIETNAM NATIONAL TEXTILE AND GARMENT GROUP - VINATEX | 45
concerns over the impact of protectionist policies on
private investment and consumer spending.
The IMF warned that rising trade protectionism,
increased tariff barriers and expanded domestic
subsidies could have negative results not only for the
U.S. economy but also for global growth. Highly open
economies such as China, East Asian countries, and
the ASEAN region are expected to be most affected by
the new wave of tariffs, while Europe faces dual risks
from weakening trade and volatile energy prices. Global
trade is now at risk of disruption and the recession has
returned.
Additionally, other macroeconomic risks persist,
including the Russia–Ukraine war, conflicts in the
Middle East, rising tensions in the Taiwan Strait,
and newly emerging geopolitical flashpoints. These
factors continue to strain global supply chains and
commodity prices. Oil and food prices could spike
again if conflicts persist or escalate, thereby putting
upward pressure on inflation. While the IMF projects
global inflation to decline in 2025, it remains elevated
at around 4.2% and may fluctuate significantly in
response to continued geopolitical instability. The IMF
further cautions that monetary policy may struggle to
remain steady if external cost shocks persist.
In the short term, the new U.S. tariff policies will
increase pressure on consumer budgets, creating
inflationary risks and potentially prompting the Fed to
maintain higher interest rates for a prolonged period.
Consequently, demand for textiles and garments
in the U.S. may decline, and Vietnam’s textile and
garment industry will face heightened competition
from countries with more favorable tariff conditions.
Moreover, high tariffs could prevent Chinese textiles
and garments from entering the U.S. market, resulting
in oversupply being redirected to major markets such
as the EU, Japan, South Korea, and even Vietnam.
In light of these developments, Vinatex’s BoD must
continue closely monitoring tariff policy changes and
proactively provide early market insights and forecasts
to support member units in formulating flexible action
plans for 2025. At the same time, the BoD will actively
coordinate with government authorities and industry
associations to propose policy recommendations that
help protect the interests of Vietnam’s textile and
garment industry in international trade agreements.
The BoD considers this a pivotal period to enhance
resilience,
safeguard
market
share,
stabilize
production, and reaffirm Vinatex’s position in the
global supply chain amid a fluctuated market. This will
serve as a foundation for the Group’s development
plan for the 2025–2030 period.
Key strategic directions include maximizing all
available opportunities, negotiating with customers,
enhancing production and quality management,
and accelerating the achievement of 2025 business
objectives. In parallel, the Group will continue to
restructure its supply chain towards a “green – clean –
diversified – flexible” model, increasing the localization
rate of raw materials to reduce dependence on third-
party suppliers especially prioritizing materials from
Vinatex’s member units. Furthermore, emphasis will be
placed on R&D and exploring niche markets with high
value-added products.

OPERATIONAL REPORT OF THE
EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT
I. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW
1. Global Economic
Context (2020-2025)
The past period has witnessed unprecedented fluctuations in the
global economy, particularly due to the profound impact of the COVID-19
pandemic and its consequences on all aspects of economic and social.
The 2020-2022 period was a highly challenging time as the COVID-19
pandemic,
causing
severe
economic
recession.
Widespread
social distancing measures, border closures and travel restrictions
led to disruptions in global supply chains, production stagnation.
and interruptions in international trade. According to international
organizations, global GDP declined by approximately 3.1% in 2020, marking
the sharpest contraction since the Great Depression.
During this period, consumer demand fell sharply due to declining incomes.
concerns about the pandemic. and restrictions on in-person shopping.
At the same time, production was severely affected by shortages of raw
materials, labor, and social distancing measures.
The 2022-2024 period saw a global post-pandemic economic recovery
driven by large-scale fiscal and monetary stimulus packages from
many countries. However, this recovery was uneven across regions and
industries and remained many uncertainties.
The global economy during this period faced three major challenges:
First. increasing political instability in various regions, particularly
the Russia-Ukraine conflict and other geopolitical tensions, which
disrupted trade activities and drove up energy and food prices.
Second. prolonged high inflation forced central banks to tighten

Impact
the
Textile and Garment
Industry
The global and Vietnamese textile and garment industry has been
particularly affected by the macroeconomic fluctuations. The industry’s
supply chain was disrupted during lockdown periods, from raw material
supply and production processes to transportation and product
distribution.
Consumer demand for textile and garment products dropped strongly as
incomes declined and spending priorities shifted toward essential goods.
Major markets such as the U.S, and the EU recorded a notable reduction in
spending on fashion items.
Textile and garment orders plummeted, became fragmented, and
imposed stricter requirements regarding quality and delivery timelines,
Import partners demanded suppliers adhere to increasingly stringent
standards on environmental protection, labor rights, and corporate social
responsibility in an intensely competitive market.
The year 2023 was considered the “bottom” of Vietnam’s textile and
garment industry, with export turnover dropping by over 10% compared
to the previous year. This was a significant decline, especially for one of
Vietnam’s key export sectors. Many businesses in the industry faced order
shortages, labor reductions, and even shutdowns.
In 2024, the industry showed signs of recovery, benefiting from the shift
of orders away from Bangladesh a country facing political instability and
worker strikes demanding wage increases. However, the fiber segment
continues to operate below cost due to fierce competition from lower-
cost producers, particularly in China and India.

impressive growth. The average annual growth rate

III. BUSINESS STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION
In a challenging business environment, the Group has proactively implemented various comprehensive
solutions to maintain and expand its business operations, These solutions focus on four key areas: investment
and production expansion, product and market development, human resource development, and digital
transformation.
1. Investment
and Production
Expansion
The Group has made investments in infrastructure development and
production capacity enhancement across its three main sectors: spinning,
weaving, and garment manufacturing.
Spinning: The Group currently operates 655,588 spindles, meeting
internal production demands and supplying partners. This large-scale
operation gives the Group an advantage in production volume and the
ability to fulfill large orders.
Weaving: The Group has achieved a production capacity of 8,490 tons
per year of knitted fabric and 69,000,000 meters per year of woven fabric.
Expanding fabric production capacity is a key step in building a vertically
integrated value chain, ensuring control over raw materials, and increasing
added value.
Garment Manufacturing: The Group has utilized general production lines,
indicating future growth potential when the market fully recovers. The
Group has optimized the current production capacity while remaining
prepared for expansion as soon possible.
2. Product and Market
Development
The Group has actively diversified the markets and products to minimize
risks and seize new opportunities.
Despite market fluctuations, the Group maintained stable export growth,
particularly in 2024, as the garment industry recovered. This success is
attributed to maintaining product quality, meeting customer demands,
and fostering strong relationships with traditional partners.
A major breakthrough in product development strategy is the collaboration
with Coats Group, a partner with advanced technology and expertise, to
produce flame-retardant fabrics. This high-value-added product meets
the growing demand for specialized, safety-compliant materials in
industries such as construction and manufacturing.
3. Human Resource
Development
Human resources are always considered a key factor in the Group’s
sustainable development strategy. During the 2020-2025 period,
especially after the Covid-19 pandemic, the Group implemented effective
measures to retain and develop its workforce.
Employee Retention: The employee return rate reached 95% after the
pandemic, an impressive figure compared to industry challenges in
rehiring. This outcome reflects the Group’s effective HR policies, positive
work environment, and timely support for employees.
Training Programs: The Group has actively conducted upskilling programs
with over 1,500 trainees participating. These programs focus on technical
skills, soft skills, and management training, equipping employees with the
necessary expertise to adapt to new technologies.
4. Digital
Transformation
Recognizing the importance of technology in enhancing competitiveness,
the Group has accelerated digital transformation across all aspects of
business operations.
Smart Manufacturing: The Group has invested in intelligent management
systems, automation and advanced technology applications to improve
production efficiency and product quality.
AI and Big Data Integration: The adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
and Big Data analytics enables market trend forecasting, production
optimization, accurate customer demand prediction and data-driven
decision-making.
Sustainability Focus: Digital transformation has improved operational
efficiency, reduced production costs and created a solid foundation for
sustainable growth in the era of Industry 4.0.

1. Global Economic
Forecast
(2025-2030)
The 2025-2030 period is expected to bring both challenges and
opportunities for global economic development, particularly for the textile
and garment industry.
The global economy is projected to grow at an average rate of 3% per
year, reflecting post-pandemic recovery and geopolitical adjustments.
However, there will be a clear divergence between regions and countries,
with emerging economies in Southeast Asia and South Asia having
stronger growth prospects compared to developed economies.
Key factors influencing the global economy include:
The trend of multipolarization in international economic relations and
production and consumption.
The rise of the digital economy and e-commerce.
Increasing sustainability and social responsibility standards.
For the textile and garment industry, consumer trends will continue to shift
towards sustainability, eco-friendly materials, and socially responsible
products. High-value-added and specialized textile products will become
increasingly popular.
2. The trend of
multipolarization
in international
economic relations
and the widespread
wave of trade
protectionism.
Based on the market assessment before the announcement of the
U.S. reciprocal tariff policy and internal capabilities, Vinatex has set the
business targets:
The 2025
Parent company: Revenue target of VND2,440 billion (+9% YoY), pre-tax
profit of VND 215 billion (+38% YoY).
Consolidated results: Revenue target of VND18,315 billion (same as 2024),
pre-tax profit of VND910 billion (+9% YoY).
The 2025-2030 period
First, strive to achieve an average annual revenue growth rate of 8-10%,
with consolidated profit growing over 10% per year, reaching twice the
2024 level by 2030. The parent company’s profit is targeted to grow
15-20% per year, tripling by 2030 compared to 2024, significantly
surpassing the previous period. This goal is based on assessments of
the global market recovery and the company’s technological, product,
and market strengths.
Second, focus on developing a green and sustainable ecosystem, aligning
with global textile industry trends and meeting increasingly stringent
requirements from import partners. This includes energy conservation,
emission reduction, and the use of recycled and eco-friendly materials.
Third, invest in high-quality human resources with diverse skills to support
modern, sustainable production. This is considered a breakthrough
strategy to drive growth, enhance competitiveness, and penetrate
deeper into the global textile supply chain. Additionally, improve employee
compensation policies, aiming for annual average wage increases of 2-3%
above actual CPI growth.
The Group continues to monitor market developments, particularly the
tariff policies of the Trump administration, in order to update and adjust
its business plans for 2025 and the 2025–2030 term.
4. Key Strategies
Market Development
Proactively build and refine a closed supply chain while improving market
forecasting capabilities to meet origin requirements and effectively
leverage opportunities from FTAs, particularly EVFTA.
Given the volatility of the global market due to economic, political, and
environmental factors, enhancing market forecasting capabilities is
a key factor in enabling the Group to proactively manage business
operations, Specific solutions include:
Applying data analytics and AI to monitor market trends, forecast
consumer demand, and track raw material price fluctuations.
Strengthening cooperation with market research organizations to
ensure accurate and timely updates on demand and consumption
trends in key export markets.
Establishing internal communication channels and an early warning
system for risks related to the supply chain, trade policies, and
macroeconomic fluctuations.
Developing niche markets and specialized customer segments to
strengthen and enhance the Group’s competitive advantage.

1. Context in 2024
2. Risk Management
Objectives
Economic fluctuations: In 2024, the global economy remained volatile,
impacting exchange rates, production costs, and consumer demand.
These factors directly affected supply chains and raw material prices
in the textile and garment industry.
Competitive pressure and digital transformation: The rise of
regional and global competitors, along with trends in automation
and digitalization, required businesses to enhance technological
capabilities to maintain their competitive edge.
Environmental and workplace safety requirements: Legal regulations
on environmental protection and occupational safety were tightened,
requiring enterprises to invest in green technology and improve
production processes.
In 2024, Vinatex issued the Risk Management Policy (RMP) with the
following objectives:
Identify both external and internal risks and proactively implement
risk management actions to minimize potential risks affecting the
Vinatex’s operations, ensuring sustainable growth and achievement
of strategic plans.
Clearly define the responsibilities of each department and unit in risk
management.

3. Key Risks
Tariff Policy
The trade war between major economies such as the United States and
China has significantly impacted Vietnam’s textile and garment industry
one of the country’s key export sectors which is facing numerous risks:
 Higher tariffs compared to competitors:
If Vietnamese textile and garment products are subjected to higher
tariffs than those of competing countries, the sector could suffer serious
consequences. A significant tariff gap would threaten competitiveness,
particularly given the already narrow profit margins in the industry.
 Decline in global consumer demand:
The trade war weakens the global economy, which in turn reduces
consumer spending especially on non-essential goods such as textiles
and garments.
 Increased compliance pressure:
Regulations on the origin of raw materials and accessories are expected
to become stricter, requiring greater transparency and traceability in
sourcing.
 Supply chain disruptions:
Trade tensions may restructure global supply chains, causing disruptions
in logistics, increasing transportation costs, and leading to longer delivery
times.
Supply Chain and Price Volatility Risks
Vietnam textile and garment industry relies on 60-80% imported raw
materials (fabrics, yarns, cotton, dyeing chemicals and accessories).
This dependency makes the industry vulnerable to price fluctuations and
global supply chain disruptions since domestic production cannot fully
meet demands in terms of volume, quality and cost.
Exchange Rate Risk
As a key export sector, Vietnam textile and garment industry was
significantly affected by exchange rate fluctuations in 2024, particularly
the VND/USD exchange rate:
Average exchange rate: 25,056 VND/USD
Highest rate: 25,486 VND/USD
Lowest rate: 24,269 VND/USD
The VND depreciation against the USD, especially in Q3, resulted from
the U.S. Federal Reserve’s (Fed) tight monetary policy, creating both
opportunities and challenges for the industry.
Production and Technology Risk
Technology remains a bottleneck preventing Vietnam’s textile and
garment industry from moving up the value chain.
Equipment and automation: Many enterprises still use outdated
machinery with low automation levels, leading to low productivity
and difficulty in meeting quality and production capacity standards
compared to competitors who invest in modern technology.
R&D investment and digital transformation: Limited investment in
research and technology applications hinders innovation and the
adoption of value-added production, affecting the industry's global
competitiveness.
Market and Competition Risks
Changing customer demands and fierce competition from Bangladesh,
China, and India, which have lower production costs, pose significant
challenges for Vietnamese textile and garment firms in maintaining export
market share especially in the context of increasing quality and “green”
requirement in FTAs.
Labor Risks
The textile and garment industry, which employs a large workforce, is
facing labor shortages, particularly in skilled and young workers, due to:
Low wages and poor working conditions, causing workers to shift to
higher-paying industries.
Labor migration trends, reducing the availability of skilled labor for the
textile-garment sector.
Higher skill requirements as the industry moves toward automation
and advanced technology. While, traditional workforce is not
adequately equipped with the necessary knowledge and expertise,
cannot meet the high standard.
Digital transformation pressures, requiring skilled workers who can
operate and manage modern machinery.
Operational and Cybersecurity Risks
With rapid digital transformation, Vietnam textile and garment industry is
increasingly adopting automation, IoT, and IT systems, which introduces
new risks:
Production disruptions due to cyberattacks or IT system failures,
affecting productivity and financial performance.
Data breaches, exposing customer, production and supply chain data
if security is inadequate.
High maintenance costs for cybersecurity, software updates,
employee training and monitoring systems.
Reputational impact, as cybersecurity incidents can damage trust
among customers and business partners.

EXPANDING THE FUTURE
OF FLAME-RETARDANT FABRICS
Vietnam National Textile and Garment Group (Vinatex) and Coats Group (UK) recently
celebrated the first anniversary of their Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the
production of flame-retardant fabrics and apparel. Additionally, the two corporations
signed an agreement to establish a strategic alliance between Vinatex and Coats and
entered into a cooperation contract between this alliance and Duc Giang Corporation
THE FIRST TEXTILE AND GARMENT PRODUCT
WITH COPYRIGHT RECOGNITION
After a period of research and development, Vinatex's
flame-retardant fabric has officially been introduced
to the market. The product is manufactured through a
closed production chain, from fiber to garment, on the
woven fabric production line of Nam Dinh Textile and
Garment Corporation.
To produce fire-retardant fabric, the yarn must be
made from aramid fiber, a synthetic fiber resistant to
high temperatures (meta-aramid) and highly durable
against abrasion and friction (para-aramid). It is
combined with other components such as anti-static
materials, Modal acrylicLyocell. With fiber lengths
ranging from 38mm to 51mm and multiple components
within the yarn (some as low as a few percent),
specialized machinery is required, including precision
blending and weighing systems and specialized
spinning machines.
Once woven, the fabric undergoes high-pressure
dyeing at temperatures above 130°C using strictly
selected European dyes and chemicals to ensure users
safety and environmental compliance (in accordance
with international standard 120).

including fire-resistant fashion fabrics.
With a cautious approach to the market, production
capacity and equipment capability, Vinatex has decided
to invest in 2025 to meet technical requirements. This
includes multi-component fiber blending and metering
machines, specialized 51mm fiber spinning machines,
dedicated yarn spinning and fabric weaving lines, high-
pressure dyeing machines for high-temperature fabric
dyeing, shaping and shrink-retardtant machines, as
well as laboratory equipment. At the same time, the
company will enhance management capacity, adopt
digital technology, and implement product traceability
software to ensure quality.
From 2025 to 2030, Vinatex aims to focus on developing
new and differentiated products with high added
value as a key strategy to enhance competitiveness
and achieve sustainable growth. Leveraging the
strengths in producing sewing threads and garment
accessories, as well as pioneering the application of
high-performance materials, Coats Group serves as a
comprehensive partner in helping Vinatex realize the
strategic goals. This collaboration opens opportunities
for
access
advanced
