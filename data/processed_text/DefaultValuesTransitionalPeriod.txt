TRANSITIONAL CBAM PERIOD GLOSSARY INTRODUCTION
The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is an environmental policy
instrument designed to support the EU climate ambitions of achieving a net reduction of
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of at least 55% by 2030 and of reaching climate
neutrality by 2050 at the latest. The CBAM will apply the same carbon price to imported
goods as would be paid by installations operating in the European Union (EU). In doing
so, the CBAM reduces the risk of the EU's climate objectives being undermined by
production relocating to countries with less ambitious decarbonisation policies (so-called
‘carbon leakage’) and introduces a strong signal to producers in third countries to
decarbonise.
The CBAM does not target countries, but the embedded greenhouse gas emissions of goods
imported into the EU for a number of specific sectors that are within the scope of the EU
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and that are at high risk of carbon leakage. These
are: iron and steel, cement, fertilisers, aluminium, hydrogen and electricity. It also includes
some precursors and some downstream products of the aforementioned sectors (hereinafter
referred to as “CBAM goods”).
CBAM will be introduced gradually. The transitional period from 1 October 2023 to 31
December 2025 is important to allow for a careful, predictable and proportionate transition
for EU and non-EU businesses, as well as for public authorities.  During this period,
importers of CBAM goods will only have  to report greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)
embedded in their imports  emissions embedded in their imported goods(direct and indirect
emissions), without paying any financial payments or adjustments.1 The monitoring and
reporting rules for the transitional CBAM period are laid out in Implementing Regulation
(EU) 2023/1773.2 Verification of those emissions by an external third party will be purely
voluntary.
The Implementing Regulation on reporting requirements and methodology provides for
flexibility when it comes to the values used to calculate embedded emissions on imports
during the transitional phase. Until the end of 2024, companies will have the choice of reporting in three ways: (a) full reporting according to the new methodology (EU method); (b) reporting based on an equivalent method (three options) and (c) reporting based on default reference values (only until July 2024, i.e for Q4 of
2023 and Q1&Q2 of 2024) (1)  Regulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 May 2023 establishing
a carbon border adjustment mechanism. OJ L 130, 16.5.2023, p. 52–104. Available from: (2)  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773 of 17 August 2023 laying down the rules for
the application of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards
reporting obligations for the purposes of the carbon border adjustment mechanism during the transitional
period. OJ L228, 15.9.2023, p. 94–195. Available from: As of 1 January 2025, the implementing regulation provides that only the EU method will
be accepted. The Commission will assess this in view of the experience during the first 4
reporting periods.
In order to help declarants with their reporting obligations, additional simplifications or facilities have been integrated (or will be integrated soon) in the online dedicated reporting
tool, the CBAM transitional registry. Some of them are the following: • Option for recording emission data of a specific good to be reused in subsequent
reports (feasible from the second quarterly report in April 2024)
• Option for reconducting the previous report updating the imported quantities
• Option for reporting data based on an XML file to allow reporting declarants automatise their own process to reuse previous reports data whenever appropriate
• Clarification that for operators, the default reporting period is twelve months to
allow them to collect representative data that reflects an installation’s annual
operations. The twelve-month reporting period may be either a calendar year or
alternatively a fiscal year. However, operators may also choose an alternative
reporting period, of a least three months, if the installation participates in an eligible
MRV system and the reporting period coincides with the requirements of that MRV
system.
Access to the CBAM transitional registry should be requested through the National
Competent Authority (NCA) of the Member State in which the importer is established.
Default values play a specific role in CBAM implementation during the transitional period
as presented in the next sections:
• Section 2 of this document outlines the use of default values for CBAM goods
other than electricity
• Section 3 of this document outlines the use of default values for determining
indirect emissions embedded in CBAM goods other than electricity
• Section 4 of this document outlines the use of default values for electricity as
CBAM good The European Commission has also issued two written guidance documents to help
importers and installation operators outside the EU to navigate the transitional period (1
October 2023 – 31 December 2025) with the reporting obligations. These guidance
documents are updated regularly. DEFAULT VALUES FOR CBAM GOODS OTHER THAN ELECTRICITY IN THE
TRANSITIONAL CBAM PERIOD
General
Whilst the general approach for imported CBAM goods other than electricity is that
declarants will have to report based on actual embedded emissions according to the
monitoring methodology that is laid out in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773
(with the flexibilities mentioned above), Default values do play a specific role in CBAM
implementation during the transitional period in particular if importers do not have all the
necessary information:
During the three first quarterly reports (Q4 of 2023 and Q1&2 of 2024), declarants
may report embedded emission  based on default values made available and
published by the European Commission without quantitative limit
ii.
From Q3 of 2024 and until the end of 2025, declarants can still report emissions
based on estimations but only for complex goods and with a limit of 20% of the
total embedded emissions. Using default values would qualify as ‘estimation’.
This section of the document provides the default values for CBAM goods other than
electricity that may be used for reporting embedded emissions during the transitional
CBAM period until 31 December 2025, under the conditions listed above. Declarants
should use them when they do not have or are not able to report actual emissions. These
default values will be regularly revised, from the first reporting quarter, to take into account
the data collected in that first reporting period as well as feedback from both the EU
industry and from non-EU producers of CBAM goods. The values in this section represent a ‘world’ average, weighted by production volumes.
They are based on estimations on embedded emissions in CBAM goods (i.e. iron and steel,
cement, fertilisers and aluminium) as carried out by the Commission’s Joint Research
Centre (JRC). The emission intensities were estimated for different countries through a
transparent methodology on the basis of publicly available data. The JRC study3 focused
on the EU’s main trading partners, covering around 15 to 20 countries for each sector in
the CBAM scope. The default values for hydrogen are based on a separate JRC report4,
published in November 2023.
The default values in this section apply independently of the country of origin of the
CBAM goods and only until the end of the transitional period on 31 December 2025. From
average emission intensity of each exporting country, increased by a proportionately
designed mark-up. Those default values will be determined through an implementing act
planned for adoption in 2025. (3) Vidovic, D., Marmier, A., Zore, L. and Moya, J., Greenhouse gas emission intensities of the steel,
fertilisers, aluminium and cement industries in the EU and its main trading partners, Publications Office
of the European Union, Luxembourg, 2023, , JRC134682. Available from: (4) Dolci, F. and Arrigoni, A., Estimation of the global average GHG emission intensity of hydrogen
production, Publications Office of the European Union, Luxembourg, 2023, ,
JRC135067. Available from: The sector tables below give default values at the 4, 6 and 8-digit CN code level5 for use
in the transitional CBAM period.
• Default values given at a 4-digit CN code level apply to all goods falling within
this 4-digit CN code category.
• Default values supplied at a 6-digit CN code level apply to all goods falling
within this 6-digit CN code category.
• Default values supplied at an 8-digit CN code level only apply to the specific
goods listed under the 8-digit CN code.
Default values are given in tonnes of CO2e emissions per tonne of goods. If a row in the
table contains several CN codes, but only one set of default values (i.e. one direct, one
indirect and one total), those default values apply to all CN codes in that row. (5) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1577 of 21 September 2020 amending Annex I to

GOODS OTHER THAN ELECTRICITY IN THE TRANSITIONAL CBAM PERIOD
The general approach for determining embedded indirect emissions in CBAM goods other
than electricity is to use default values for the emission factor for electricity. Indirect
emissions are then calculated by multiplying those default values with the amount of
electricity consumed to produce the respective CBAM goods.
The default values represent the average emission factors of the country of origin
electricity grid, based on data from the International Energy Agency (IEA).14 These data
are not published in this document but are made available to reporting declarants through
the CBAM Transitional Registry.
The default values in the CBAM Transitional Registry represent the 5-year average
emission factors for electricity covering the years 2016 to 2020. They are provided for
around 150 countries. If a default value is not available for a specific country, the Registry
attributes the world average emission factor as provided by the IEA. In the case of a few
countries, the IEA dataset does not contain emission factors for the years 2016 to 2020,
due to the high share of renewable electricity in the electricity grid. In the case of these
few countries, the default values are set to zero. If a reporting declarant does not want to use the default values made available by the
Commission, there is also the possibility to use any other emission factor of the country of
origin electricity grid based on publicly available data representing either the average
emission factor or the CO2 emission factor. Moreover, actual emission factors for
electricity may be used in the case of a) a direct technical link between the installation in
which the good is produced and the electricity generation source or b) a power purchase
agreement between the consumer and the producer of the electricity for an amount of
electricity that is equivalent to the amount for which the use of a specific value is claimed.
Provisions on the use of emission factors other than those provided by the Commission
can be found in Annex III, Section D.4 of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773.
The default values referred to in this section apply only until the end of the transitional
Those values will be set as the average of:
• the emission factor of the Union electricity grid,
• the emission factor of the country of origin electricity grid, or
• the CO2 emission factor of price-setting sources in the country of origin.
The default values for the determination of indirect emissions applicable from 2026
onwards will be determined through an implementing act planned for adoption in 2025. (14) International Energy Agency (IEA): Emission factors 2021. DEFAULT VALUES FOR ELECTRICITY AS CBAM GOOD IN THE TRANSITIONAL
CBAM PERIOD The general approach for determining embedded direct emissions for electricity as CBAM
good is to use default values for the CO2 emission factors. CO2 emission factor means the
weighted average of the CO2 intensity of electricity produced from fossil fuels within a
geographic area. Embedded direct emissions are then calculated by multiplying those
default values with the amount of electricity imported into the EU.
The default values represent the average emission factors of the electricity produced from
fossil fuels in the country of origin, based on data from the International Energy Agency
(IEA).14 These data are not published in this document but are made available to reporting
declarants through the CBAM Transitional Registry.
The default values in the CBAM Transitional Registry represent the 5-year average CO2
emission factors covering the years 2016 to 2020. They are provided for around
15 countries, representing the countries from which electricity is currently exported to the
EU or potentially in the near future.
Under certain conditions, other emission factors may be used, as specified in Annex III,
Section D.2 of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773.
The default values referred to in this section apply only until the end of the transitional
Those values will be set at the CO2 emission factor in the third country, group of third
countries or region within a third country, based on the best data available to the
Commission. They will be determined through an implementing act planned for adoption
in 2025. GLOSSARY

Common customs tariff, setting import duties for products
imported into the European Union (EU), as well as the
Integrated tariff of the European Communities (Taric),
incorporating all EU and trade measures applied to goods
imported into and exported out of the EU; ii) the
