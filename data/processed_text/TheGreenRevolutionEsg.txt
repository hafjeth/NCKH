In todays market, sustainability is the new currency. Consumers are increasingly scrutinizing
the brands they support, demanding transparency and ethical practices. For apparel
companies, this shift has placed a spotlight on corporate responsibility, making ESG a
cornerstone of brand reputation. This analysis delves into the essential role of ESG in the
textile industry, highlighting how environmental, social and governance criteria are
reshaping business operations. Discover the compelling pressures from global markets and
learn ffom pioneering Vietnamese companies that are leveraging ESG to build trust, secure
their place in the supply chain, and pave the way for a more sustainable future.
In todays globalized economy, textile and garment corporations worldwide are increasingly
compelled to implerment Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices with utmost
transparency. This imperative stems not only from tightening legal requirements but also
from significant pressure exerted by consumers. Modern shoppers, particularly younger
demographics, are demonstrating a growing preference for “green” brands that prioritize
ethical labor practices and supply chain transparency.
The Crucial Role of ESG in the Textile Industry
Amidst escalating globalization and the urgent demand for sustainable development,
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors have emerged as pivotal considerations
for businesses within the textile and garment sector. Embracing ESG principles allows
companies to not only meet evolving legal and market demands but also to enhance their
standing and bolster competitive advantage for long-term sustainability.
Understanding ESG: Environmental, Social, and
Governance Pillars
ESG is an acronym representing three core pillars: Environmental, Social, and Governance.
s Environmental (E): This pillar addresses how a company manages its natural resources, reduces
greenhouse gas emissions, and handles waste.
s Social (S): The social component focuses on labor conditions, employee rights, and community
engagement.
s Governance (G): Governance pertains to how an organization operates with transparency,
accountability, and efficiency.
Together, these three interconnected pillars form the bedrock for businesses aiming to
Operate sustainably and adhere to international standards.

ESG - The three pillars of environment, society, and governance
Global and Vietnamese ESG Implementation in the
Textile Sector
The textile and garment industry is notoriously resource-intensive, generating substantial
emissions throughout its production, consumption, and post-consumption phases. Globally,
numerous major textile corporations have proactively adopted ESG strategies to mitigate
environmental impact, enhance labor conditions, and strengthen corporate governance.
s Fast Retailing (Uniqlo, GU): This conglomerate is actively transforming its supply chain, significantly
increasing the use of recycled materials, with recycled polyester reaching 47.4%. They aim toreduce
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 90% in stores and offices and utilize 100% renewable electricity.
Socially, initiatives lixe “The Heart of LifeWear” (donating over 552,/000 products) and the “PEACE FOR
ALL” project demonstrate their commitment. In Vietnam, Fast Retailing further supports clean water
access, school construction, and employment for people with disabilities.
s H&M Group: H&M has pledged to cut Scope ï, 2, and 5 GHG emissions by 56% by 205O, with a long-
term goal of achieving Net-Zero by 2040. They have already reduced Scope 5 emissions by 24%
compared to their 2019 baseline. Currently, 89% of their materials are recycled or sustainably sourced,
including 29.5% recycled content. The company prioritiZes renewable electricity, achieving 96% in
Operations, and plans to eliminate coal from its garment supply chain by 2026. Socially, H&M
champions labor rights, occupational safety, and collective bargaining. z  -

In Vietnam, where the textile industry forms a significant portion of national exports, robust
ESG implementation is becoming a prerequisite for accessing premium markets, retaining
customers, and enhancing brand value. Furthermore, to export to demanding markets like
the US and Europe, Vietnamese textile enterprises must provide clear evidence of carbon
neutrality. The EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), effective ffom 3anuary 1,
2026, particularly underscores the urgent need for Vietnamese textile businesses to prioritize
ESG compliance.
International Market Demands and Global Trends Driving
ESG Adoption
Key international markets, including Europe, the United States, and 3apan, are imposing
increasingly stringent ESG requirements across supply chains. Textile businesses failing to
fully integrate ESG practices risk exclusion from these lucrative markets. Concurrently, the
global trend towards sustainable investing means that investors are increasingly prioritizing
companies that demonstrate strong ESG compliance.
The escalating regulatory pressures, new policies, and trade barriers ftom importing markets
are evident in several prominent examples:
s Europe~- Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD / EU): The EUS CSDDD mandates
that companies within its scope identify, prevent, and mitigate human rights and environmental
risks throughout their value chains. This directive will compel EU importers to demand evidence
from their suppliers, including textile manufacturers, regarding impact assessments, policies, and
remedial actions. Consequently, this significantly elevates the need for transparency and traceability
from exporting manufacturers.
s Europe - Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM): CBAM is designed to impose a carbon levy
on imported goods, aiming to equalize carbon costs between EU domestic products and imports.
While initially targeting carbon-intensive sectors, CBAMS implications (and related legislative
amendments) are prompting importers and fashion brands to request embedded emissions data
from textile suppliers. This data is crucial for assessing future cost risks and ensuring compliance.
s Europe- EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) & Sustainable Textiles Strategy: The EUDR requires
Droof that agricultural and forestry-derived materials (such as certain types of viscose, wood, or
cotton linked to forest areas) are not associated with deforestation. Simultaneously, the “Textiles
Strategy” and proposals like Ecodesign and Green Claims are intensifying pressure for supply chain
transparency, restricting hazardous substances in fabrics, and combating greenwashing. This means
businesses must provide verifiable documentation and independent evidence of origin for raw
materials like fibers, viscose, and cotton.
s Europe - Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH): REACH isa
Ccomprehensive regulation governing the registration, evaluation, authorization, and restriction of
chemicals, applicable to all products imported into the EU, including textiles. This regulation requires
companies to control and eliminate harmful substances (e.g., azo dyes, heavy metals, or PFAS) from
their production processes. European brands and importers are increasingly demanding that
Vietnamese textile suppliers demonstrate REACH compliance through chemical inventories, regular
testing, and safety certifications, ensuring products meet both ESG standards and EU environmental
regulations.
s Japan and Other Asian Markets: Japan and several other Asian markets also enforce strict standards
concerning chemical safety, recycling, and waste management.

Châu Âu - Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Vietnam's Evolving Legal and Policy Framework for ESG
In recent years, Vietnam has consistently refined its legal system concerning environmental,
social, and corporate governance (ESG) to foster sustainable development and international
integration. These new regulations are particularly impactful for the textile and garment
industry.
Environmentally, the Environmental Protection Law 2020O, along with guiding decrees and
decisions, has tightened controls on emissions, wastewater treatment, and hazardous waste
management. Significant documents such as Decree 06/2022/ND-CP . (on greenhouse gas
emission reduction), Decree 08/2022/ND-CP. (guiding the Environmental Protection Law),
Decisions 888/QD-TTg, 896/QD-TTg, 841/QD-TTg, and most recently Decision 13/2024/QD-TTg
on greenhouse gas inventory, all aim to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change in line
with Vietnam' Net Zero 2050 commitment.
From a social perspective, the Labor Code 2019 serves as a foundational document for
protecting employee rights, clearly stipulating standards for safe working conditions, non-
discrimination, and prohibiting forced labor. The law also promotes workplace dialogue,
collective bargaining, and union rights, thereby establishing a basis for transparent and
humane working environments.
This increasingly comprehensive ESG policy frArmework acts as both a pressure point and a
driving force for Vietnamese enterprises especially in manufacturing and textiles to invest
in clean technologies, transparent governance, and sustainable human resource
development.
Pressure from Customers, Investors, and Supply Chain
Partners
Today, global fashion conglomerates are mandated to implement ESG transparently, driven
not only by increasingly stringent legal requirements but also by direct pressure from
consumers. Shoppers, Darticularly the younger generation, are showing a growing preference
for “green” brands that uphold human rights and demonstrate transparency in their
production processes.
A 2024 study by Verónica Baena, titled “The shift frfom fast fashion to socially and sustainable
fast fashion,” revealed a highly positive customer response to Zaras ESG and social
responsibility. initiatives.. When. Zara launched specific programs, such as creating
employment for people with disabilities (For&From), developing eco-friendly product lines
(0oin Life), and transparently communicating its ESG efforts, customer purchase intent, trust,
and loyalty all significantly increased.

ESG implementation pressure on textile enterprises from customers, investors, and partners
This trend underscores that to maintain reputation and competitive advantage, major brands
are compelled to publicly disclose their carbon footprint and ensure full transparency across
their entire production process, ffom raw materials to finished goods. Consequently, they
demand that their manufacturing and supply partners in Vietnam meet similar ESG criteria:
rigorous environmental . management, guaranteed labor rights, and clear information
disclosure.
Therefore, ESG is no longer an optional choice but a mandatory condition for Vietnamese
garment factories and suppliers to remain part of the global supply chain. Proactively
embracing green transitions, efficient energy use, chemical control, and transparent
production processes not only helps businesses meet partner requirements but also creates
long-term advantages, enhances reputation, and expands export opportunities into high-
value markets.
