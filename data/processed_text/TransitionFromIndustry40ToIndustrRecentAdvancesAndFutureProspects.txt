Introduction
The progression of 1industries across different stages of
technological growth has been a defining feature of human
c1Vilization. Every stage of the 1industrial revoluton from
the first, which was categorized by mechanization and
stcam poWwer, to the present, which 1s defined by automa-
tion, ethical supply chain management, and AI has altered
lifestyles, ểcconomies, and commumnities (Groumpos 2021; S.
Kumar cet al. 2024a, b). However, the 1ndustry 1S once again
set for a significant approach to Industry 5.0, a new age in

2019a). In this regard, the textile and apparel 1ndustry, a vital
part of International trade and manufacturing, finds 1tself at a
criucal crossroads, navigating the transiuon to Industry 5.0
while facing opportunities as well as challenges (Rahaman
et al. 2021; Yang and Gu 2021). Industry 5.0 represents a
sIignificant evolution beyond Industry 4.0. It alters the focus
from automation and smart manufacturing to human-centric,
sustainable, and resilient production systems (Golovianko
et al. 2023). It integrates advanced digital technologics
with human expertise to cnhance sustainability, efficiency,
and personalization. Unlike Industry 4.0, which primarily
emphasizes automation, robotics, and AI, Industry 5.0 rein-
troduces human creativity and problem-solving alongside
smart systems to create a more balanced, adaptive, and eco-
conscious manufacturing ecosystem (Mourtzis et al. 2022;
Z1Z1c et al]. 2022). In the context of addinve manufacturing
for clothing, this transituon allows for highly customized, on-
demand apparel production with minimal waste, addressing
sustainability concerns 1n textlle and apparel manufacturing
Ệ Springer
(S. Ram et al. 2024). The 1ncorporation of Industry 5.0 tech-
nologies enables real-ume adaptability 1n production, where
AI-driven design systems work alongside human creatvity
to develop unique and funcuonal apparels (Donmezer et al.
2023a). Robotics and collaborative robots (Cobots) assist in
complex manufacturing processes, ensuring precision while
reducing ]abor-intensive tasks (Addula and Tyagi 2024).
Additonally, smart materials and fabricaton techniques
are being 1ntegrated 1nto clothing production, enhancing
durability, comfort, and environmental sustainability. Man-
ual sk1l] of weaving and spinning 1s the foundation of the
centuries long history of the clothing industry. Technology
has transformed textile manufacturing, creating the way for
DrOCess mechanization during the 1°' Industrial Revolution
(Allen 2011). The modern clothing 1ndustry 1s shaped by
other developments brought about by later stages of indus-
trialization, 1ncluding the 1ntroduction of synthetic fibers,
mass manufacturing methods, and work automation (Sikka
et al. 2024). Yet Industry 4.0 also brought with 1t previously
unheard levels of automation and connection, bringing with
1t the era of digital supply chains, smart 1ndustries, and data-
driven decision-making (Bertola and Teunissen 2018; RaJa
Santhi and Muthuswamy 2023a). Textile manufacturers are
now able to increase operating efficiency, 1mprove product
quality, and streamline manufacturing processes because of
these breakthroughs (Sandvik and Stubbs 2019). However,
1t has also brought with 1t a new set of challenges for the
clothing Industry, such as worries about automation taking
1obs, cybersecurity threats from linked systems, and upskill-
1ng workers to keep up with quickly changing technologies.
The clothing industry 1s positioned for yet another paradigm
transion as the world moves toward Industry 5.0, which 1s
defined by the fusion of human-centric approaches with mod-
ern technology like AI, robotics, and the IoT (Akundi et al.
2022; X. Xu et al. 2021a). Unhike earlier industrial revolu-
tons, which frequently emphasized replacing human labor
with machinery, Industry 5.0 places a strong emphasis on col-
laboratung with both human and robots to take use of their
disunct strengths and 1ncrease production and Innovation
(Ônday 2019). This transformation has enormous potential
for the clothing 1ndustry, providing opporturities to cnhance
Supply Chain Management (SCM), advance sustainability
standards, and 1mprove product personalization (Kazancoglu
et al. 2023, 2024a). By combining modern technology, smart
textiles that can monitor health parameters, adapt to their sur-
roundings, and Improve user comfort can be ensured (Raha-
man et al. 2025a, b; Ramasubramanian et al. 2022; Selvasudha
et al. 2021). Additionally, the concepts of Industry 5.0 have
the potential to expedite the creation of flexible manufacturing
procedures, thereby enabling textile manufacturers to promptly
adapt to evolving consumer tastes and market demands (Aslam
et al. 2020; Saniuk and Grabowska 2023). As the clothing
1ndustry adopts Industry 5.0, 1t can also have to overcome a
Ổề Springer

number of challenges. The bigøest of these 1s having to getrid
Of outdated systemns and 1nÍfrastructure that can make it harder
for new technologies to be adopted. Many textile manufactur-
@Is WOTk in settings with antiquated equipment, compartmen-
talized data systems, and low employee digital literacy (Irfan
and Salam 2020). In order to meet these challenges, large
sums of capital can need to be spent on technology upgrades,
and extensive training programs can be necessary to provide
the workforce with the skills needed to succeed in 1ts set-
tĩng (Acemoglu and Autor 2011; Kukulska-Hulme 2012).In
addition, as modern technologies become more widely used,
the clothing 1ndustry can have to deal with moral and social
ramifications (Niinimäki and Hassi 201 1). To ensure that the
advantages of Industry 5.0 are fairly spread throughout society,
concerns about algorithmic bias, data privacy, and the 1mpact
Of automation on cmployment can be properly explored and
addressed (Martini et al. 2024).
According to exisung literature gap, there 1s stll a lack of
comprehensive reviews regarding the convenience Of IACOTDO-
rating modern technologies like AI, the IoT, and robotics into
the clothing sector for Industry 5.0, particularly in relauon to
sustainable additive manufacturing practices (S. Ahmed et al.
202%b, a; Flores-Siguenza et al. 2022; Maddikunta cet al. 2022;
Ahmed and Maccarthy 2021; Reino-Cherrez et al. 2023;
Safavi Jahromi and Ghazinoory 2025). While the adoption of
Industry 4.0 technologies in the clothing 1ndustry 1s growinø,
there 1s a lack of detalled case studies on the practical 1mple-
mentation of Industry 5.0. There 1s stlll a gap in developing a
systematic frAmework that guides the transiuon from Industry
4.0 to Industry 5.0, specifically for sustainable and additive
manufacturing 1n the clothing 1ndustry, integraung human-
centric approaches with digital tcchnologies.
This review paper will explore the transition from Industry
4.0 to Industry 5.0 In the context of sustainable and addi-
tUve manufacturing of clothing. It w1ll discuss the impact of
1ndustrial revoluuons on additive manufacturing, emphasizing
the transition towards human-centric and sustainable pracuices
n Industry 5.0. It will highlight key technologies for 1mple-
menting Industry 5.0, such as AI, automation, and robotics,
and compare the limitations of Industry 4.0 with the advancc-
ments provided by Industry 5.0. Case studies are presented to
showcase successful 1mplementations, and recent advances in
the clothing 1ndustry are discussed. This review w1ill conclude
by addressing challenges and proposing future prospccts for
Industry 5.0's role in textile and apparel manufacturing.

Industrial Revolutions in Additive
Manufacturing of Clothing
The evolution of addituve manufacturing in the clothing
1ndustry has been significantly influenced by the progres-
sion of 1ndustrial revolutions. Figure 1 shows the evoluton
Of the clothing 1ndustry over time. From the mechanization
of clothing production in the 1°' Industrial Revolution to
the 1ncorporation of modern technology in Industry 5.0, the
Materials Circular Economy (2025) 7:20
clothing industry has been crucial to the historical develop-
ments of industrial revolutions.
Industry 1.0
The industrialization of textile manufacturing in the latc
cighteenth century marked the start of the 1®' ¡ndustrial
revoluuon in Britain. Small workshops or people`s houses
(the putting-out system) would use hand tools and primi-
tIve machines to make textiles before the Industrial Revolu-
tIon (O”Brien et al. 2012). Manufacturing textiles moved
to Industries that uscd water-or stcam powered machinery
with the arrival of the Industrial Revolution 1.0 (Tomory
2016). The use of machinery like power looms and spinning
frames substantially raised output per worker. The spinning
Of yarn was revolutionized by inventions like the spinning
mule, water frame, and spinning Jenny, which also increased
output and cfficiency (Hahn 2016). The power loom devel-
Oopment 1ndustrialized the weaving process, specding up the
production of textiles and encouraging the constructon of
1ndustries (Allen 20138).

Industry 2.0
Technological developments n the late ninetecnth and carly
twentieth century had taken place in textile manufacturing
(Rosenberg 1963). The clothing 1industry observed iniual
technological improvements during the 28v industrial revolu-
tion (Mokyr 2001). The extensive use Of electricity to pOWCeT
industries was a major breakthrough of the 2"Š Industrial
Revolution (Zou ct al. 2016). Because electricity 1s more sta-
ble and easier to regulate than steam or water, 1t has largely
supplanted older forms of power generaon. Texule design
and production were changed by 1nnovations like the Jac-
quard loom, which employed punched cards to regulate the
Wweaving of 1ntricate patterns (Harlizius-Kluck 2017). The
clothing industryˆs capabilities were 1ncrcased by the 1ntro-
duction of synthetic fibers, dyes and chemical processes,
which made 1t possible to produce a greater variety Of colors
and fabrics (J. Chen 2015; Z. Feng and Rầnby 1992; Raha-
man et al. 2024a, b).
Industry 3.0
Automation and dig1tization were brought to the clothing
industry during the 3"Š industrial revolution. The manufac-
ture of textiles 1s now more precise and efficient because
Of the replacement of traditnonal mechanical methods with
computerized looms and knitung machines (Ahmed et al.
2022; Mait et al. 2022). With the ability to quickly pro-
totype and customiZe designs, CAD and CAM technology
transformed the textile desiøn and pattern-making industries
(Sinha 2020). The textile industry has been utterly trans-
formed by the 1introduction of advanced manufacturing tech-
nology including computer-controlled knitting machines,
and laser cutting (S1 et al. 2022). With the help of these
technologies, manufacturing prOcesses can be more precise
and flexible, enabling the production of 1ntricate and person-
alized textile 1tems with reduced waste.
Industry 4.0
Industry 4.0, often known as the fourth 1ndustrial revolu-
Uon, 1ntroduced digital technologies and networking to the
clothing 1industry (Burns et al. 2019; Muhuri et al. 2019).
The emergence of e-textiles with cembedded electronics and
sensors allowed for the Ö1Implementation of features like bio-
metric monitoring, moisture management, and temperature
control (L. Da Xu et al. 2018). The manufacturing of textiles
was revolutionized by advanced manufacturing prOCesses
like 3D printing and additive manufacturing, which made it
possible to create 1ntricate structures and forms with lttle
waste (Ahmad et al. 2020; X. Xu etal.2021a).
Page5of37 20
Industry 5.0
A new transition 1n manufacturing 1S cmerging with the
advent of “Industry 5.0” which cmphas1Zes the casier combi-
nation of human skills and adyanced technology (Grabowska
et al. 2022). Figure 2 shows the various stages of 1ndustrial
revoluons in textiles and apparel. Industry 5.0 priorItiZes
sustainability, resilience, and customization, highlights the
collaboration between human creativity and advanced tcech-
nology. When 1t comes to addiuve manufacturing of clothing,
Industry 5.0 encourages a transiuon from mass production
to mass custom1Zation, allowing 1temÄs to be produced with
little waste. This transformation facllitates locali:zed, on-
demand manufacturing, encourages effective resource usaøce,
and lowers overproduction, all of which are in acceptable
harmony with sustainability goals. It 1s seen as a return to
fashion design and customiZation n the apparels and texule
1ndustries. Robots and automation help to make certain tasks
easler, but human artisans are sũll needed to make unique,
personalized clothing with elaborate patterns that reflect each
person's taste (Pinto et al. 2024; Safavi Jahromi and Ghazi-
noory 2024). In addition to encouraging sustainable accept-
able clothing 1tems and decreasing waste through efficient
production methods, 1t promotes sustainable behaviors (Alo-
1aiman 2023; Rahaman and Khan 2024a, b; Zayedul Hasan
et al. 2021. In general, the use of Industry 5.0 in the textile
and apparel production promotes a revolutionary step towards
fashion that 1s 1nventive, sustainable and focused on the needs
of people. Through modular designs and easier disassem-
bly, additive manufacturing can 1mprove clothing circularity,
which emphas1Zes reusing, repairing, and recycling materials
for as long as feasible. Humancentered design, which com-
bines AI, robotics, and additive manufacturing technology
can produce high functional and clothing 1tems (Rami et al.
2024). For example, 3D printing can be used to create wear-
able clothing from bio-based or recyclable polymers that can
be decomposed and reused. It deduces the 1mpact on the envi-
ronment and landfil] garbage while promoting a closed-loop
fashion business (Hu et al. 2014). Addiuonally, Industry 5.0
makes 1t possible for the manufacturing process to be more
transparent and traceable, empowering consumers to make
ethically sound purchasing decisions.
Concepts of Industry 5.0 from the Point
of View of Clothing Industry
Continuing upon the foundations established by Industry
4.0, Industry 5.0 1s frequently heralded as the era of human-
machine collaboration (Bai et al. 2020; Barreto et al. 2017).
It emphasiZes the critical role that human workers play in
tandem with state-of-the-art technologies. Industry 5.0 aims
to achieve a harmonic balance between human creativity,

technology like robotics, machine learning, AI, and the IơT
1nto manufacturing processes while placing a fresh focus
on human-centered methodologies (Chander cet al. 2022;
Javaid et al. 2021; C.-C. Wang and L1 2022). Numerous
1sSUeS CODfront the clothing 1ndustry, from supply chain
complexity and environmental concerns to cost constraints
and worldwide rivalry (W. A. H. Ahmed and MacCarthy
2021; Villar et al. 2023). Textile manufacturers can maxi-
m1Ze productivity, reduce downtime, and optim1Ze produc-
tion workfiows by utilizing IoT-enabled sensors, robotic
automation, and AI driven predictive maintenance. Informed
decision-making 1s further facilitated by real-time data ana-
lyucs, which permits ongoing process enhancements (Tien
2017). Real-ume monttoring and control of manufacturing
DTOCeSSeS aT© made possible by Industry 5.0 technologies,
which also facilitate customization based on 1ndustry pref-
erences and ensure adherence to strict quality requirements
(Sakare et al. 2023). In order to ensure consistent product
quality and enable rapid 1nterventions, advanced analyt-
1cs algorithms 1dentIfy varialons or flaws early on. In the
clothing industry, sustainability has become a top prIOTIty,
leading to a move toward sustainable procedures and the
concepts of the circular cconomy (Balanay and Halog 2019;
Rahaman et al. 2025a, b; Repp et al. 2021a). Industry 5.0
Ễ Springer
enhances a more environmentally sustainable approach to
clothing manufacturing by enabling resource optimization,
Wwaste reduction, and energy efficiency through smart manu-
facturing techniques (Leng et al. 2024). Texule manufactur-
ers need flexible and robust supply chains to adapt quickly
to shifung market conditons and reduce risks 1n a volatile
and unpredictable economy. It ensures smooth coordination
throughout the whole value chain by enabling supply chain
optimiZzation through real-time data 1nterchange, predicuve
analyucs, and smart logistics (Karthik and Gopalakrishnan
2014; Suarez-Visbal et al. 2023). Industry 5.0 enables chal-
lenges such as Job displacement, and aims to enhance human
WOFkers` capacities by giving them access to modern cquip-
ment, encouraging systems, and training (Adel 2022). In
order to enable the workforce to drive organiZational growth
and competiuveness, human-machine collaboraton develops
a culture of 1nnovation, creativity, and conunuous learning.
Key Elements and Characteristics of Industry 5.0
The next stage of Industrial development, khown as Industry
5.0, emphasizes the well-balanced fusion of modern technolo-
g1es and human knowledge. Industry 5.0 1s characterized by
a human-centric approach as 1t emphas1Zes on the collabora-
tIon between human and technology to enhance efficiency and
well-being. t 1s an approach in which people and machines
cooperate harmontiously by uũlizing one another's advantages
and both are key essential components (Bellet et al. 2013).
It imtegrates AI and automation while ensuring that human
Materials Circular Economy (2025) 7:20
expertise remains central for decision-making. Addition-
ally, hyper-personalization enables customized productuon
designed to 1ndividual preferences using advanced data ana-
lyucs. Cobots play a significant role 1n this specific approach
as 1t works alongside human to 1mprove productivity, safety,
and precision in manufacturing. It 1s a kind of cooperation
encourages 1nvention, creativity, and problem-solving, which
makes 1t possible to manufacture clothing 1tems to suit spe-
c1fic requirements. Sustainability 1s another top priority to
reduce negative effects on the environment by using sustain-
able clothing 1tems, energy-saving techniques, and waste
managcement tecchniques (Brockhaus ct al. 2017; Mathew and
Spinelli 2025; Pranta et al. 2024). Another characteristic 1s
flexibility, as production processes are built to quickly adJust
to shifting consumer tastes and market demands. Various sys-
tems and components are 1nterconnected and 1nteroperable,
facllitating smooth data transmission and communication and
1mproving productivity and decision-making. Industry 5.0's
essential elements are displayed in Figure 3a and the essential
characteristics of Industry 5.0 are 1llustrated in Figure 3b.

Human-Machine Centricity
Industry 5.0 places a strong emphasis on collaboration
between humans and machines while acknowledging 1ts
own special abilities. It focuses on adapting advanced diøi-
tal technologies while enhancing easier human-machine
1nteraction (Ivanov 2023). It enhances human-machine
collaboration to an advanced level. It transits the focus of
manufacturing from system driven processes to human-
machine centered approaches. In a sense, this marks
a return to the foundational principles of manufactur-
ing while still emphasizing ecconomic and sustainability
considerations (Jefroy et al. 2022). The cooperation in
the clothing 1ndustry means using automation, robotics,
and AI to complement human knowledge and abilites
rather than to replace them (Monopol: et al. 2025). While
machines execute repetiuve Jobs, human workers supervise
and control industrial processes, 1ncreasing productivity
and efficiency (Modoni and Sacco 2023). AT-driven sys-
tems, Cobots, and smart automation encourage productiv-
1ty can enable the workers to concentrate on creativity,
1nnovation, and quality control (Kazancoglu et al. 2024b).
Technologies such as AI-supported custom1zation, Auø-
mented Reality (AR), and digital twins can facilitate
personalized clothing manufacturing and streamlined
manufacturing. This 1ntegration can create a sustainable,
efficient, and worker-friendly clothing 1ndustry with a total
balanced automation with human supervision (Donmezer
etal.2024).
loT Integration
Through the connection of equipment, sensors, and devices
across the apparel manufacturing environment, IoT tech-
nologies are essential to Industry 5.0. In Industry 5.0, the
Integration of IoT In the clothing Iindustry can make per-
sonalization, efficiency, and sustainability to the next level.
JoT enabled smart texles can communicate with devices to
gather data and allow for the real-time monitoring of produc-
tion processes, cquipment performance, and product quality
1n the clothing 1ndustry (Manglani et al. 2019; ReJeb et al.
2020). Sensors can be Integrated 1nto machinery and cquip-
ment. It can cnable real-time tracking of apparels during the

Advanced Data analytics
Advanced data analyUcs plays a pivotal role in enhancing
decision making and optilm1Zing processes. Industry 5.0
uses big data analytics and machine learning, among other
advanced data analytics approaches, to extract meaningful
1ns1ghts Írom massive volumes of manufacturing data (Akter
et al. 2022). It enables predictive maintenance that can
reduce downtime by antcipaung equipment failures before
the event takes place. Data analytics can be applied to the
clothing 1ndustry to Improve production schedules, forecast
maintenance requirements, and find areas for process opti-
mization. Real-time production data analysis enables manu-
facturers to make well-informed decisions that encourage
productivity and cut expenses without meeting any unwanted
failures (Kabugo et al. 2020). The combinaton of advanced
data analyics and real time decision making can promote
the clothing 1ndustry towards a more advanced and smarter
operations.
Automation and Robotics
Industry 5.0 in the clothing 1ndustry relies heavily on auto-
mation and robotics technology to automate labor-intensive
and repetIive processes (Wollschlaeger et al. 2017). The
1ntegration of Cobots 1s a key step toward smarter manufac-
turing systems 1n the context of Industry 5.0. By uũlizing
Cobots, manufacturing processes can be enhanced with the
minim1Zation of low-value tasks for workers. It can help to
focus on more advanced responsibilities that robots strug-
gle with due to task fiexibility (Bednar and Welch 2020;
Frank et al. 2019). However, a recent study highlighted the
factors that Influence managersˆ 1ntentions to adopt Cobots
1n manufacturing brands, but 1t did not explore the actual
usage stage (Correia Simðões et al. 2020). The adaptation of
automation and robotics can open endless possibilitues for
the clothing 1ndustry. t can create more efficient and produc-
tve industry. Numerous manufacturing operations, 1nclud-
1ng cutting, stitching, and packaging, can be carried out by
automated systems w1ith accuracy and efficiency (Gangoda
et al. 2023). Automation and robotics speed up production,
minimiZe error rates, and enhance overall product quality
while freeing up human labor for more difficult Jobs.
Digital Twins
The inclusion of building virtual versions of real manu-
facturing assets, procedures, and end clothing Items, digi-
tal twin technology enables manufacturers to model and
enhance production processes 1n a virtual setting (Davila
Delgado and Oyedele 2021). This parucular technology pro-
vides a real-time dynamic model that mimics the operation
Of physical systems and clothing 1tems. It helps to Improve

Materials Circular Economy (2025) 7:20
the conUnuous optimization and troubleshooting without
disrupting actual operations (Javaid et al. 2023; Leng et al.
2021). The clothing 1ndustry can be particularly beneficial
through digital twins as 1t has the traits to test and simu-
late process modificatuons, anticipate potential disrupUons,
and 1dentify 1nefficiencies before making physical changes.
This test process modificaons of digital twins can be 1mple-
mented, simulate various manufacturing situations, and
model production hnes (Donmezer et al. 2023b). The capa-
bility enables textile manufacturers to simulate the entire
producton line for better resource allocation, 1Improved
quality control, and prcdictive maintenance strategies. Con-
sequently, manufacturers can significantly reduce waste,
1ncrease manufacturing efficiency, and shorten the time
required to launch new items which ultimately enhances
sustainability and cost-effectiveness in production.
Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)
VR refers to a fully 1mmersive, computer-generated environ-
ment that allows users to 1nteract with a 3D world with the
use of headsets and controllers (Wohlgenannt et al. 2020).
On the other hand, AR overlays digital content onto the real
world, often viewed through devices such as smartphones,
tablets, or AR glasses (Dargan et al. 2023). Both of them
allow for 1nteracũve simulations and virtual environments
that provide workers with hands-on experience without
physical constraints. These technologies ensure a safer and
more efficient training process (Yazdi 2024). Industry 5.0
1S Improved by these technologies through the provision of
training tools and 1mmersive visualizations for production
processes. The clothing 1ndustry can be benefitted through
AR and VỀR as 1t has the potential to provide pragmatic
knowledge and experience in the context of different sec-
tIOns of manufacturing. AR and VỆR can be uũlized in the
textile business for 1nteractive training simulations, remote
maintenance encouraøe, and virtual product design (Radianti
et al. 2020). In clothing manufacturing, these technologies
enhance better collaboration, shorten training times, and
1ncrease worker safety.
Circular Economy
By maximiZing resource use, eliminating waste, and reduc-
1ng environmental 1mpact, Industry 5.0 encourages sus-
tainability and circular economy concepts 1n the textile
(Senthilkannan Muthu 2019). It highlights sustainability
by combining human-centered approaches with advanced
technologies, leading to smarter and more sustainable manu-
facturing processes. In this Íramework, sustainability goes
beyond waste reduction and energy efficiency. As global
environmental concerns ørow, 1ndustries are ureed to reduce
environmental Impact while sũl] maintaining efficiency.
Materials Circular Economy (2025) 7:20
Manufacturers can now use sustainable production meth-
ods, recycling, and upcycling to advanced technologies. Tex-
tile manufacturers can encourage a more environmentally
conscious and sustainable manufacturing ecosystem (Reike
et al. 2023). Contemporary waste management practices are
Increasingly focused on sustainability and eco-friendliness
(Nayak et al. 2021; Tareque Rahaman et al. 2021). As a
result, circular economy practices are 1ncreasingly encour-
aged in today”s Iindustries. Various models have been devel-
oped to promote the circular cconomy, parucularly within
the manufacturing process. These models are adopted to
ensure the sustainability of the clothing industry.
Zero Waste Strategy. A Zero-waste policy aims to optimize
resource efficiency and reduce waste generation throughout
the cntire manufacturing, consumption, and disposal process
(Song et al. 2015). Redesigning clothing 1tems, processes,
and systems promotes the cfficient use of materials and aims
to eliminate waste. The approach focuses on the principles
Of “reduce, reuse, and recycle” and encourages composting
and recycling efforts, along with product repair and reuse
programs. The Zero-waste policy 1s in line with Life Cycle
Assessment (LCA), reducing textile waste at every staøe of
production and consumption. It prioritlZes resource efficiency
by designing durable, recyclable clothing with minimal envi-
ronmental ¡impact. Diverting waste from landfills through
reuse, recycling, and proper disposal helps to reduce carbon
emissions and pollution. This strategy enhances a circular
economy, ensuring sustainable texũlle waste management
with a small environmental footprint. It works for waste
reduction at the source, allowing businesses to reduce envi-
ronmental 1mpact and better util1Ze resources. Collaboration
among manufacturers, retailers, consumers, and lawmakers
1s the key to 1mplementing Zero-waste policies throughout the
supply chain, enabling organiZzations to reduce environmental
hazards and preserve natural resources, advancing toward a
sustainable and circular economy.
3R Concept The 3R principle (reduce, reuse, recycle) 1s
essential for advancing sustainability 1n the clothing 1ndus-
try. It helps to minim1Ze resource consumption, minimiZe
Wwaste production, and repurpose materials, thereby reducing
the cnvironmental footprint. Reusing textiles prolongs the
lfe cycle, decreasing the need for new raw materials. Recy-
cling transforms waste fabrics 1nto new clothing 1tems, con-
tributing to a circular economy in fashion. Reducing waste
via the 3R approach 1s a highly effective strategy for promot-
Ing sustainable waste management (Mitra and Datta 2014).
The environmental iImpact at cach stage of a textile prod-
ucts lfe 15 minim1zed 1n alignment with LCA. Recycling
and reusing building waste contribute to the achievement
of SDGs. These procedures are frequently used to create
new clothing 1tems from the significant amounts of waste
Page9of37 20
generated on-site (Schrocder et al. 2019). The strategy holds
the potential to revolutioniZe the approach, reducing the
need for exploring natural resources while simultaneously
extending the lifespan of landflls. Resources are preserved,
and waste treatment costs are reduced (Sarkodie and Owusu
2021). Effecuve waste management plays a pivotal role in
encouraging the circular cconomy. It focuses on the princi-
ples ofreducing, reusing, recycling, and recovering materi-
als (Daukantiene, 2023). In 2010, £238 £249 million worth
ofreusable or recyclable textiles were discarded by residual
waste collectors. By recovering Just 10% of this, around £25
mullion 1n sales could be generated. Textiles for manufactur-
1ng clothing contribute significantly to the cnvironmental
footprint, accounting for one-third of the waste footprint,
three-quarters of the carbon footprint, and the majJority of
the water footprint In circular business (Okafor et al. 2021;
Rahaman and Islam 2021).
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) A legislative strat-
egy called EPR transfers the responsibility for managing a
products end-of-life effects from consumers or local gov-
ernments to the manufacturers. Under EPR, manufacturers
are accountable for the entire product lifecycle, including
production, collection, recycling, and disposal (Khetriwal
et al. 2009). The goal 1s to create long-lasting clothing 1tems
that are sustainable and easy to recycle or dispose of pTOp-
erly. By shifung responsibility to manufacturers 1nstead of
consumers or municipalities, 1t encourages sustainable prac-
tIces and helps to minim1Ze the environmental impact of
clothing 1tems throughout their entire life cycle (Matambo
2021). EPR programs differ 1n specifics, yet the core con-
cept remains that manufacturers are required to handle the
end-of-life consequences of the clothing 1tems through
regulations or agreements. These environmental product
return schemes encompass 1tems such as electronics, bat-
teries, packaging, and hazardous materials. These serve as
an effective mechanism to promote Tesource conservation,
reduce waste, and 1mprove environmental sustainability in
product design and manufacturing.
Green Packaging In packaging, the term “øreen” refers to
clothing 1temÉs that are either manufactured from cnvironmen-
tally sustainable materials or used 1n a manner that minimiZes
environmental harm. The goal 1s to reduce the environmen-
tal 1Impact of packaging, starung from the extraction of raw
materials to 1ts final disposal. Green packaging efforts include
reducing packaging waste through 1nnovative design and
optimization, as well as using renewable and biodegradable
materials such as paper, cardboard, and compostable plastics
(Wandosell et al. 2021). Reducing packaging s1ze and weight
to limit emissions associated with transportation 1s another
aspect Of green packaging proJects (Svanes et al. 2010). Recy-
clable materials and recycled content are also 1ncorporated
Ẩễ Springer
1nto packaging (Motaleb et al. 2024). By adopting these prac-
tiIces, businesses are able to reduce environmental 1mpact.
Valuable resources can be conserved, and waste and polluuon
from packaging materials can be minimized. This approach
emphasizes the 1mportance of priorIUZing green packaging
techniques. Additonally, the demand for sustainable pack-
aging solutions 1s growing. Grecn packaging 1s Increasingly
preferred by consumers, prompting businesses to embrace
more sustainable methods. Reducing the harmful effects of
product packaging on the environment, grecn packaging plays
a crucial role in this effort (Pranta et al. 2023).
Lean Manufacturing Lean manufacturing, also known by
Var1ous terms such as Just in Time (JIT) production. It1s a
method aimed at Improving manufacturing efficiency and
minim1Zing waste. Originating from the Toyota Produc-
tIon System, lean manufacturing focuses on maximizing
the use of limited resources to meet consumer demands
(Yamamoto and Lloyd 2019). It 1s fñrmly based on guid-
1ng principles, 1ncluding, JTT manufacturing, conUnuous
1mprovement (Kaizen), and pull-based production (Bend-
ers and Van BiJsterveld 2000). The key principles of lean
manufacturing 1nVolve minimiZing the risks of overproduc-
tion or obsolescence and limiting ¡nventory holding costs.
It 1s centered on delivering clothing 1tems and services to
clients, operating on a pull-based system where production
1s determined by consumer demand rather than schedules or
projections. This method allows for more efficient resource
distribution and prevents overproduction. It also emphasizes
the significance of respecting workers and granting them
the autonomy to excel 1n their roles. The goal of lean manu-
facturing 1s to optim1Ze efficiency, reduce waste, enhance
quality, and 1ncrease productivity. As a result, consumers

ronmental footprint.
Technologies for Implementing Industry 5.0
In the clothing 1ndustry, technologies that facilitate Industry
5.0 include Cobots that work alongside human workers to
enhance precision and efficiency in tasks such as clothing
assembly, quality control, and cutting (Lu et al. 2022a). AI-
driven systems help to optimize designs by predicting trends
and consumer preferences, while IoT-enabled devices enable
real-time momnitoring of machinery and 1nVentory, Improving
workflow and reducing waste (P. Kumar et al. 2022). Indus-
try 5.0`s future transitions in the clothing 1ndustry are 1llus-
trated in Figure 4. With the arrival of Industry 5.0, which
stresses the fusion of 1nnovative technologies and human
1nteligence, the textile 1ndustry 1s poised for significant
change. The study explores the potental and challenges that
Industry 5.0 brings to the clothing 1industry.

Wearable Textiles
In smart and wearable textiles, Industry 5.0 technologies
focus on enhancing the interaction between humans and
machines for addiuye manufacturing. It also serves the
duty of sustainability and customization. Key technologies
1nclude AI and machine learning that enable adaptive func-
tonalities n fabrics such as monitoring vital signs, adJust-
1ng temperature, and detecting environmental conditions
(Chinnappan et al. 2017). Texules with integrated sensors
and microelectronics allow for the development of smart
clothes for sports, wellness, and medical applicauons (Mon-
dal 2008). These textiles can monitor physiological factors
1ncluding body temperature, heart rate, and activity. Wear-
able technology g1ves wearer hands-frec access to Informa-
tion and connectivity by being 1ncorporated 1nto clothing
for communication, navigation, and entertainment reasons
(Y. Zhang et al. 2023a, b). Cobots work alongside humans
to enhance production efficiency and customization. At the
same time, blockchain technology ensures traceability and
transparency in the textile supply chain. These technologies
combine to drive the transformation of e-textiles and it make
them more personalized, sustainable, and 1nteractive, paving
the way for the next era 1n wearable technology (W. A. H.
Ahmed and Maccarthy 2021).
Antimicrobial and Self-Cleaning Textiles
In the context of anumicrobial and self-cleaning textles,
several technologies are playing a pivotal role 1n 1ts 1mple-
mentation 1n additve manufacturing. The applicauon of
nanotechnology 1s central as 1t allows for the 1ncorporauon
Of anUmicrobial agents such as silver (Ag) nanoparticles or
copper oxide (CuO) into textile ñibers (J. Ghosh et al. 2025;
M. Khan et al. 2024; Rahaman and Khan 2024a, b). These
nanoparticles exhibit excellent antimicrobial properties and
actively prevent bacterial growth and enhance the hfespan of
textiles (Momotaz et al. 2024). Incorporating self-cleaning
and antibacterial properties to textile surfaces through the
application of nanotechnology and photocatalytic coatings
can minimize odor accumulation, 1ncrease hygiene 1n appar-
els, and reduce the need for frequent washing (Hosen et al.
2024; M. S. H. Khan et al. 2025). Implementing self-sani-
tIZIng textiles 1n public transit, medical textiles, and the hos-
pitality industry can help to reduce the spread of ¡nfectious
diseases and cnhance public health results (Saha ct al. 2024).

use ÁR to try on clothes virtually through apps or 1n-store
displays, providing a personalized shopping experience. In
addiuon, AR can be employed in manufacturing for train-
Ing purposes where WOTkers can receIive real-time guidance
and 1mprove cefficiency (Berryman 2012). It 1s being 1nCOT-
porated into apparel and accessories to provide consumers
with 1mmersive shopping cxperiences. It cnables them to
see things 1n real tme, alter designs, and engage with virtual
aspects prior to making a purchase (De Silva et al. 2019).
AR features are 1ncorporated into retall setungs, fashion
shows, and marketing campalgns to 1Improve brand narra-
tIve, engagce consumers, and close the gap between online
and offline purchasing channels.
3DPrinting
The use of sustainable materials and sustainable 3D print-
ing technologies also aligns with the Industry 5.0 goals
Of reducing waste and 1ncreasing energy efficiency. These
technologies collectively encourage a more human-centric,
adaptable, and sustainable approach to addituve manufactur-
1ng. Customi1zed clothing and accessories are manufactured
possible by the use of addiuve manufacturing technolo-
gies, which also help to reduce material waste and enable
on-demand production based on specific body measurements
and style choices (Dorsey et al. 2022). Adding 3D-printed
components to textiles to Improve their structural soundness,
v1sual attracUveness, and useful characterisucs like complex

3D Knitting
Industry 5.0 In additive manufacturing, particularly in 3D
knitung 1ntegrates advanced technologies to cnhance the
production of textiles with a high degree of customization
and automation while focusing on human-centric prOCesses
(Igarashi et al. 2008). AI 1s uũliZed to optimiZe design prO-
cesses, predict material behavior, and facilitate real-time
adJustments during production (Elahi et al. 2023). Machine
learning algorithms can adapt knitting patterns to mcet spc-
cIẾñc requirements that ensure precision and reduce waste
(Zulfiqar et al. 2024). Additionally, IoT allows for smart
monitoring of machines, providing real-time data for main-
tenance, performance tracking, and operational efficiency
(Soori et al. 2023). Robotics and automation systems are
also key components that enable the smoother production
Of complex, multi-dimensional knit structures with mini-
mal human 1ntervention. Another crucial technology 1s cloud
computing that provides a platform for collaborauve desigøn
and remote control of manufacturing processes and enhances

3D Printed Accessories
Industry 5.0 represents a paradigm transiuon where human
1ntelligence, creativity, and collaboration are integrated
with advanced technologies. In the realm of 3D printing,
particularly 1n the producton of accessories, Industry 5.0
technologies enable a more personalized, custom1zed, and
efficient approach. Key technologies facilitating the transi-
tIon 1nclude advanced AI algorithms for design optimiza-
tion, which allow for the creation of 1ntricate and functnional
accessories that ensures 1ndividual preferences (Seeber et al.
2020). Cobots play a crucial role 1n 1mproving production
efficiency and precision while working alongside human
Operators, ensuring both high-quality outputs and reduc-
1ng physical strain (El Zaatari et al. 2019). Additionally,
real-time data analytics and machine learning algorithms

Multi-Functional Textiles
Industry 5.0 1s a new era that emphasiZes the 1ntegrauon
of human-centric approaches with advanced technologies.
It aims to create personalized, sustainable, and 1innovative
clothing 1tems. In the context of addiuve manufacturing
for multi-functional textiles, the transition 1s enabling the
development of highly customizable and efficient textiles
with advanced features. Advanced functonaliues, 1ncluding
motsture-wicking, thermal management, odor control, and
UV protecton, are built into clothing to 1mprove comfort
and performance 1n a range of settings and actvities (G.
Chen et al. 2020). In addition, AI and machine learning algo-
rithms are playing a crucial role n optimizing the design and
production processes, ensuring that the textiles are designed
to meet spcecific requirements for applicatuions such as health-
Care, aerospace, or sports (RoJek et al. 2025). Textnles with

Blockchain in SCM
Industry 5.0 represents a significant transition 1n the way
manufacturing integrates human intelligence, creativity,
and advanced technologies. In the context of addituve man-
ufacturing, Industry 5.0 emphas1Zes collaboration between
human workers and machines to cnhance production cffi-
clency, customization, and flexibility. Blockchain provides
a decentralized, secure, and transparent system that ensures
data 1ntegrity and traceability throughout the supply chain
(Agrawal et al. 2018). By 1mplementing blockchain in addi-
tve manufacturing, businesses can track every staøe of the
Ổề Springer

production process from material sourcing to final product
delivery.It enhances the reliability of product 1nformation,
minimiZzes fraud, and ImprOVes accountability. The integra-
Uon of blockchain with JoT devices further clevates Indus-
try 5.0 by enabling real-time monitoring and secure data
sharing, facilitatuing predicuUve maintenance and reducing
downtime in additive manufacturing systems (P. Ran: et al.
2022). By enabling these technologies, Industry 5.0 1n addi-
tIve manufacturing can optimiZze supply chain transparency,
reduce costs, and create more sustainable and resilient pro-
duction systems.
AI Driven Design
Industry 5.0 focuses on human-centric, sustainable, and
1nteligent manufacturing. It 1s revolutioniZing additive
manufacturing by Integrating advanced technologies such
as AI for design. AI-driven design in additive manufacturing
enables more cfficient, adapve, and 1innovative processes by
enabling machine learning algorithms, generative design,
and optim1zation techniques (Quan et al]. 2023). These AI
tools can analyZe vast datasets, predict material behaviors,
and optimiZe øeometries to create structures that are light-
weight, durable, and cnergy-efficient. In this context, AI
aSs1sts 1n real-time decision-making helps to create custom-
1Zed, complex clothing 1tems that meet specific user needs
and environmental goals. Addiuonally, AI-powered simu-
lauons and predictive analyucs can help manufacturers to
anticipate 1ssues related to design flaws or production 1nef-
ficiencies before, further enhancing the quality and sustain-
ability of the final product (Kuzhagaliyeva et al. 2022). The
1ntegration of AI with additive manufacturing empowers a
easler collaboration between human operators and intelli-
gent machines, ensuring a more adaptive and sustainable
approach to product design and producton. These advance-
ments pave the way for highly personalized, resource-cffi-
cient, and environmentally conscious production in the era
Of Industry 5.0.
Industry 4.0's Limitations in Light
ofIndustry 5.0
Textile manufacturing”s transition from Industry 4.0 to
Industry 5.0 reveals a number of limitations of the former
Over the latter. The emphasis on automation and technology
1mprovements in Industry 4.0 frequently ignores the human
aspcect, which could result in the loss of the creativity and
artistry that are 1nherent 1n the production of textiles (Badri
etal. 2018). Flexibility and creativity can be hampered by an
OVer-reliance on automation, which can cause a rift between
the personnel and production procedures. Additonally,
Materials Circular Economy (2025) 7:20
many manufacturing components work independently, mak-
1ng coordination and data management more challenging, 1ts
fragmented systems and lack of Interoperability can result
1n inefficiencies 1n the apparel manufacturing 1ndustry (Dil-
beroglu et al. 2017). In addition, when 1t places a strong
emphasis on mass customization, efforts are frecqucently
constrained by predetermined constraints, 1t can be difficult
to produce fully custom1zed clothing 1tems at scale (Brun
and Zorzini 2009). It can disregard the environmental sus-
tainability of clothing manufacturing 1n favor of production
pTocess optim1Zation over reducing environmental 1mpact.
Figure 5 Indicates the transituoning limitations of Industry
4.0 over Industry 5.0. By reintegrating human expertise and
creativity 1nto the production process, Industry 5.0, on the
other hand, solves these shortcomings by enhancing custom-
1zation, flexibility, and sustainability while utlizing modern
technologies to 1ncrease productivity and 1nnovation in the
textile manufacturing 1ndustry (Nahavandi 2019b).

Textile manufacturers necd to make Iinvestments In employee
traiming and upskilling 1n order to accommodate the growing
emphasis on human-machine collaboration n this new tran-
sition. The transiũon to Industry 5.0 can be hindered when
there 1s a sizable talent gap brought on by the absence of
workforce development funding during the Industry 4.0 phase
(Poláková et al. 2023b).
Over-Reliance on Automation
One significant drawback of Industry 4.0 compared to
Industry 5.0 1s 1ts over-reliance on automation and 1t often
leads to a lack of human-centric approaches in produc-
tIon and service 1ndustries (Ingaldi and Ulewicz 2019).
Industry 4.0 focuses heavily on integrating smart tech-
nologies such as IoT, AI, and robotics to optimiZe pro-
duction efficiency and reduce human i1ntervenuon. While
automation enhances speed and precision, 1t also creates
challenges such as Job displacement, reduced adaptability,
and 1ncreased vulnerability to system failures (Morkovkin
et al. 2020). Industry 4.0 has wItnessed a ma]Jor Increasc
1n the use of machine learning and automation, which can
result In a decrease 1n the need for human labor (P. Sahoo
et al. 2024). Industry 5.0, however, places a sưong empha-
s1s on the value of human creativity and skill in addiuon to
automation. The adoption of Industry 5.0 can be hampered
only when the apparel manufacturing 1ndustry gets Overly

Technological Inequalities
Industry 4.0 heavily relies on automation, AI, and data-
driven decision-making and 1t often leads to a significant
gap between technologically advanced nauons and those
with limited access to digital 1nfrastructure (GaJdZik et al.
2020). Developing countries and small enterprises struggle
to keep pace with the rapid technological advancements
due to high 1mplementation costs, lack of skilled labor, and
1nsufficient digital literacy (PotoCan et al]. 2021). Industry
4.0 has resulted in a proliferatuion of different platforms,
technologies, and standards, which has caused techno-
logical dispariues and 1nteroperability challenges. It can
be challenging to accomplish smoother integration and
cooperation between humans and machines in clothing
manufacturing processes when these 1ssues are not suffi-
ciently resolved 1in Industry 5.0 (Kasinathan et al. 2022).
In contrast, Industry 5.0 emphas1zes human-machine col-
laborauon, aiming to bridge the technological 1nequality by
1ntegrating human creativity and personalized production
alongside automation. By prioritiZing 1nclusivity, sustain-
ability, and resilience, Industry 5.0 seeks to create a more
balanced technological ecosystem that benefits a broader
spectrum of 1ndustries and societies.
Data Privacy and Security
Industry 4.0 relies heavily on 1nterconnected smart sys-
tems, automation, and cloud-based data sharing. It makes
1ndustrial operations more vulnerable to cyber threats,
data breaches, and hacking. With the extensive use of IJoT
devices, AI, and big data analytics, large volumes of sensi-
tIve 1ndustrial and consumer 1nformation are continuously
collected, processed, and transmitted across digital plat-
forms (Rosin et al. 2020). Industry 4.0's enhanced con-
nection and data 1nterchange g1ve rise to data privacy and
security 1ssues. Industry 5.0 promises even more 1nteraction
between people and robots, when it 1s not handled before-
hand, can make these 1ssues worse. In Industry 5.0, textile
manufacturers can require strong data privacy and cyber-
seCurity protocols to ensure the security and 1ntegrity of
data generated by both machines and people (Kolesnikov
et al. 2024).
Implementation Cost
The transition to Industry 4.0 requires substantial invest-
ments I¡n advanced technologies such as automation, AI,
IoT, and big data analyucs (D. Ghosh et al. 2020). Setung
up smart industries 1nvolves purchasing expensive equIip-
ment, upgrading legacy systems, and integrating diøi-
tal platforms, all of which require a significant financial
Ổề Springer
Materials Circular Economy (2025) 7:20
commitment (Sezer et al. 2018). Industry 4.0 technologies
frequently come with a hefty iniUal cost associated with
1nfrastructure, cquipment, and training. Textile manufactur-
ers can find 1t more difficult to make the easier transituon
to Industry 5.0 because of being financially constrained or
reluctant to parcipate In Industry 4.0 because of percelved
r1Sks or uncertainty (Raja Santhi and Muthuswamy 2023b).
For Industry 5.0 to be adopted 1n the apparel manufacturing
1ndustry, 1t can be essential to remove financial challenges
and show the long-term advantages of the technology.
Interoperability
The interoperability of various hardware, software, and sys-
tem platforms 1s a common source of 1ssues for Industry 4.0
deployment. These challenges with 1nteroperability might
restrict the cfficacy of automation and digitalization 1m1tia-
tives by Impceding the smooth integration of tcchnology and
data 1nterchange (M. Khan et al. 2023). On the other hand,
Industry 5.0's emphasis on human-machine collaborauon
necessitates a higher level of 1nteroperability across var1ous
1ndustrial processes and human 1]aborers and technical sys-
tems. Resolving these interoperability 1ssues can be essential
to achieving 1ts full potential ¡n clothing production. Oth-
ficient resource uũ]ization, and difficulty 1n 1ntegrating new
technologies with legacy systems (Srai et al. 2016). Indus-
try 5.0, In contrast, emphasiZzes human-centric approaches
and seeks to 1mprove the connecon between digital and
physical worlds through better Integration and collaboration
between systems.
Human-Centric Focus
While Industry 4.0 has significantly transformed produc-
tion and other sectors with automation, smart tecchnology,
and data-driven processes, 1t has certain drawbacks, par-
ticularly 1n 1ts human-centric focus (B. Wang et al. 2022).
Although Industry 4.0 brought about advances 1n automa-
ton, data analytics, and networking, 1t frequently places a
higher priority on technology than on the participation of
people in problem-solving and decision-making processes
(Alves et al. 2023). The needs of the textUle manufacturing
business are better met by Industry 5.0's human-centric
approach, as design, aesthetics, and consumer preferences
are 1mportant factors. The 1integration of modern technol-
og1es and human expeTrience can enable Industry 5.0 to
enable more customi1Zed and consumer-focused clothing
manufacturing processes. It seeks to create a harmonious
relationship between humans and machines where humans
are not replaced but rather augmented by technology to
enhance their roles.

Transitioning from Industry 4.0 to Industry
The transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 represents
a significant transition in the way 1ndustries operate with
a focus on the 1ntegration of human-centric values with
advanced technology. Industry 4.0 1s often characterized by
automation, AI driven supply chain managcment, and the
use Of cyber-physical systems and IJoT. It has revolutionized
production processes by enabling smarter, more efficient sys-
tems. However, as businesses evolve, Industry 5.0 aims to
enhance the role of humans in this technologically advanced
landscape, emphasizing collaboration between humans and
machines. The components that distinguish Industry 4.0 from
Industry 5.0 are 1llustrated in Figure 6. The main disunction
remains in the integration of personalized and customized
production processes, where human crceativity, flexibility, and
problem-solving capabilities are harmonized with automa-
ton. Industry 5.0 1n the clothing 1ndustry 1s a major advance-
ment over Industry 4.0, bringing with 1t a number of unique
features that set 1t apart from the former. These elements
Fig.6 Drivers of Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0
Page15of37 20
show a trend toward more customization, flexibility, sustain-
ability, and human-machine collaboration.
Human-Centric Manufacturing
Industry 4.0 primarily focuses on the digitization and auto-
mation of processes, whereas Industry 5.0 lays more atten-
tIon on the role that human workers play in the production of
texules (C. Zhang et al. 2023a, b). While Industry 4.0 revo-
lutioniZzed 1ndustries through the use of AI, machine learn-
1ng, and 1nterconnected systems to create highly automated
and data-driven cnvironments, Industry 5.0 transitions focus
on human-centric collaboration. Instead of simply replac-
1ng human workers with machines, Industry 5.0 seeks to
1ntegrate human experience, creativity, and domain-specific
knowledge with advanced technologies to promote a more
flexible, adaptable, and collaborative industrial environ-
ment (Iu et al. 2022b). Employees with human ingenutity,
problem-solving abiliues, and domain knowledge can col-
laborate with machines to 1mprove 1ndustrial processes. The
1ntegrauon of human 1ntelligence with advanced technolo-
g1es cnhances productivity and enhances the development of
ầ Springer
more sustainable and customizced solutions in apparel manu-
facturing, leading to a more human-centered approach in the
advancement of smart manufacturing technologies.
Integration of Robotics
Industry 5.0 brings Cobots system with active and direct role
of human 1nteraction to the clothing 1industry. In contrast to
Industry 4.0`s mainly inflexible and segregated automation
systems with a minimal and indirect human 1nvolvement,
Industry 5.0 emphasizes human-centricity, flexible collabo-
ration between humans and machines, and more integrated,
adaptive technologies that align with social and environmen-
tal values. (Huang et al. 2021). Robots or Cobots work in
shared workspaces with human operators to complete tasks
that call for dexterity, quickness, or heavy lifting. Coop-
erative strategy 1mpTOVes textile manufacturing operations”
flexibility, productivity, and safety. These human-robot col-
laborations are particularly advantageous in the clothing
1ndustry where 1ntricate tasks and quick responses are often
needed. By enhancing flexibility, Cobots can adapt to vary-
1ng production demands and work in tandem with human
WOFkers to ensure higher efficiency and reduced error rates
(Faccio et al. 2023). Additionally, this coopcerative strat-
egy not only 1ncreases productivity but also contributes to
1mproved safety by minimiZing the physical strain on Work-
ers and allowing robots to handle more dangerous tasks.
Integration of human creativity and robotc efficiency marks
a sign1ficant step towards creating a more dynamic, adapt-
able, and human-centered apparel manufacturing environ-
ment (T. Wang etal. 2024).
Mass Customization
Compared to Industry 4.0, Industry 5.0 allows for higher
degrees of personalization and customization 1n the cloth-
1ng manufacturing process. Industry 5.0 introduces mass
customization, which elevates the concept of personaliza-
tion that Industry 4.0 established to new heights. Indus-
try 5.0 1ntroduced mass custom1Zation that elevates the
personalization capabihties that Industry 4.0 1ntroduced
by making it possible to create clothing 1tems that are not
only individually designed but also mass-produced cffi-
ciently (S. §. Kumar et al. 2024đa, b). Modern technologies
hke AI, JơT, and digital twins allow manufacturers to cre-
ate highly customiZed clothing 1tems at scale that satisfy
spec1fic consumer demands and market trends (S.-E. Lee
et al. 2002). With these capabilituies, brands can create more
1ndividualized clothing 1tems, reducing waste and 1mDprOV-
1ng consumer satisfaction. It marks a significant transiuon
from traditional production models where clothing 1tems
Were often one-size-fits-all, to a more consumer-centric
approach that emphasiZes flexibility, sustainability, and a
Ổề Springer
Materials Circular Economy (2025) 7:20
deeper connecton between manufacturers and consumers
(Jin and Muqaddam 2019; Vadicherla and Saravanan 2013).
Sustainable Production
Industry 5.0 places a sưrong emphasis on sustainability in the
clothing 1ndustry, setting 1t apart from Industry 4.0`s largely
efficiency-driven goals (Rahaman et al]. 2024a, b). Industry
5.0 goes beyond Industry 4.0, which focuses on streamlining
production processes for ecconomy and efficiency, by incor-
porating sustainability concerns 1nto all facets of production
opcerations (S. C. Feng et al. 2010). Sustainable production
techniques include bio-based materials, 3D printing with
recycled ñbers, waterless dyeing technologies, and closed-
loop recycling systems (F. Ahmed et al]. 2024, 2025b, a;
Pranta and Rahaman 2024). The 1ntegration of AI and big
data analytics helps to optimiZe resource utllization, reduc-
Ing material waste and cnergy consumption. Additionally,
blockchain technology enhances supply chain transparency,
ensuring ethical sourcing and sustainable practices across the
production process. It entails reducing the negative effects
on the environment, preserving resources, and advancing a
circular ecconomy by utilizing sustainable methods and tools.
Flexibility and Agility
The Transiuon from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 focuses
on moving from automation-driven efficiency to a human-
centered, adaptable, and sustainable approach with flex-
1bility and agility as key factors. Comparcd to Industry
4.0, Industry 5.0 encourages more flexibility and agility in
clothing manufacturing operations. Industry 5.0 takes fiex-
1bility to the next level by enabling quick reconfiguration of
production processes and workflows in response to shifung
market demands and production requirements (Jafari et al.
2022). Industry 4.0 1ntroduced predictive maintenance and
networked producton systems. It 1ncreases a manufacturer”s
competiuveness and responsiveness by enabhing 1t to swiftly
ad]ust to new possibiliues and challenges. In the context of
sustainable and addituve manufacturing of clothing, flexibil-
1ty and agility can allow brands to transiuon towards local-
1Zed production, digital fabrication, and responsive supply
chains, ulumately promoting a circular ecconomy.
Successful Case Studies of Implementing
Industry 5.0
Industry 5.0 focuses on the collaborauon between humans
and smart technologies and 1t has secn several successful
case studies that highlight 1ts transformative 1mpact on vari-
OUS sectors. Table 1 provides an overview on brands with

successful track records of 1ncorporating Industry 5.0. The
facility demonstrates the potential for a harmonious relaion-
ship between machines and human, with workers oversee-
1ng complex tasks while the AI handles data-driven deci-
slons. The combinatuion of human 1nvolvement and smart
technology leads to more resilient, adaptive, and innovative
production processes, helping industries to mecet the cvolv-
1ng demands of consumers and society. It provided a more
personalized and flexible producton environment where
the workforce was empowered to contribute their cxpertise
alongside automated systems. Some notable cxamples dem-
onstrate components of Industry 5.0 principles in action,
even though specific case studies and best practices 1n the
clothing 1ndustry can sull be developed.
Suzhou Tianyuan's Sewing Robots
To 1nstall completely automated sewing robots in 1ts cloth-
1ng 1ndustry, Chinese texlle manufacturer teamed up with
SoftWear Automation. These robots increase production
and reduce labor costs by sewing clothes without human
ass1stance using computer vision and ALI algorithms (Kous-
toumpardis and Aspragathos 2014). The partnership between
1ndustry (Suzhou Tianyuan Garments Company) and aca-
demia (SoftWear Automation) shows how modern technolo-
g1les can revolutuion1Ze conventional clothing manufacturing
procedures.
Zara's Fast Fashion Trends
The fast fashion brand Zara, 1ncorporated in Spain, 1s renowned
for having an flexible and responsive supply chain that Inte-
grates numerous Industry 5.0 principles (Tokatli 2008). Zara
uses real-time data analytics to 1nstantly change production and
distribution by continuously monitoring consumer preferences,
market trends, and inventory levels. With the help of fast fash-
1on business model, Zara can minimize lead times, get rid of
extra inventory, and ship stylish clothes to chients much faster
than before (Aguilar-Aguilar et al. 2023).
Adidas Speedfactory
In the fashion 1ndustry, Adidas has adopted Industry 5.0 to
enhance sustainable production. By combining 3D knitting
technologies with human creativity, Adidas has been able to
produce custom-fit apparels with minimal waste, promoting
both sustainability and innovation (Ÿ.-A. Lee 2022). Adidas
1ntroduced the SPEEDFACTORY program to 1ncorporatc
Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0 1deas 1nto the production of
footwear. These facilites use robotics, additive manufac-
turing, and advanced automation to quickly make bespoke
Materials Circular Economy (2025) 7:20
shoes. Adidas provides consumers personalized 1tems while
cutting lead times and waste by combining digital design
tools with localized production (Galluccio 2022).
Patagonias Worn Wear Initiative
Patagonia's Worn Wear 1niuative promotes sustainability by
encouraging consumers to purchase used wear, trade in old
1tems, and repair the clothing 1tems, thereby extending their
lifecycle and reducing waste. It aligns with the principles of
Industry 5.0 as 1t emphasizes human-centric and sustainable
practices, combining advanccd technology with cnvironmen-
tal responsibility to promote a circular cconomy and reduce
the fashion 1ndustry`s cnyironmental 1mpact. Although not
solely centered around Industry 5.0, “Patagonia`s Worn Wear”
1m1Uative embraces the fundamental concepts of sustainability
and circular ecconomy that are at the heart of the movement
(Hepburn 2013; O`Rourke and Strand 2017). Through this
program, Patagonia encourages clothing repatir, reuse, and
recycling, extending the hfe of their goods and reducing their
environmental effect. Patagonia promotes a more sustainable
approach to textile consumption and ImproVves consumer Inter-
action by using digital platforms and supply chain transpar-
ency (Michel et al. 2019; Rattalino 2018).
Nikes Direct Marketing
Nike has adopted the 1deas of Industry 5.0 by placing a
high priority on digital client engagement and Direct-to-
Consumer (DTOC) sales channels. It collects useful informa-
tion on consumer preferences, behavior, and performance
reviews through 1ts mobile apps and NikePlus membership
program (Knight and Greenberg 2002). It 1s able to 1ncrease
consumer loyalty, sưeamline 1nventory management, and
personalize product because of 1ts data-driven approach.
Teijins Digital Transformation
To modernize 1ts textile business, “Teijin Limited,” a global
chemical, pharmaceutical, and information technology corpo-
ration based 1n Japan, has set out on a diøital transformation
path. In order to Improve product development, manufacturing
efficiency, and consumer pleasure, brands use JoT, AI, and
data analytics through programs 1ncluding Teiiin Smart Safety,
Teijin Smart Meter, and Teijin Smart Color (Kwon 2024).
Teijin 1s posiioned as an 1nnovative leader 1n the global cloth-
1ng 1ndustry due to 1ts dedicaion to Industry 5.0 principles.
Intelligent Labels from Avery Dennison
With 1ts intelligent label solunons, the world leader in
labeling and packaging materials has 1ncorporated Indus-
try 5.0 techniques. Real-time tracking and tracing of textile
Page19of37 20
clothing 1tems throughout the supply chain 1s made possible
by the radio-frequency 1dentiication (RFID) and NFC (near
field communication) technologies included in these labels
(Schaefer and Cheung 2018). Avery Dennison assists tex-
Uile manufacturers with better 1nventory control, 1mproved
product 1dentification, and streamlined shipping processes
by uũlizing data analytics and cloud-based technologies.
Recent Advances of Industry 5.0
in the Clothing Industry
Textile manufacturing can adopt Industry 5.0, which
requires strategic approaches that combine human 1nnova-
tIon and technical integration. Texule and apparel 1ndus-
tries neced to place a high priority on developing an 1nno-
vative and ongoing learning culture that provides workers
the frecedom to accept change and adjJust to new technology
(A. Arora et al]. 2004; Zayedul Hasan, K. M. Ayatullah
Hosne Asif, et al.2021). The textile and apparel Industry`s
5.0 recent advances are 1llustrated 1n Figure 7. Investing
capital into upskilling and workforce training programs can
1mprOVe WoOrkers” digital literacy and provide them with
the tools need to collaborate with machines (L. Li 2024).
In addition, by using flexible manufacturing techniques,
textile manufacturers can react quickly to client requests
and market expectations, 1ncreasing filexibility and pleas-
ure (Crittenden et al. 2011; Ozdamar Ertekin and Atik
2015). Manufacturing processes can be optimized with
minimal environmental effects by combining sustainable
practices with modern technology like automation, AI, and
the IoT (C. Li et al. 2021; Yildirim et al. 2018). Addi-
tionally, encouraging cooperation and Joint ventures with
tech brands and academic 1nstitutions can make it easier to
obtain state-of-the art soluons and sumulate innovation
1n the clothing manufacturing industry (C.-L. Chen 2019).
Clothing brands can successfully navigate Industry 5.0 and
grab new chances for development, efficiency, and sustain-
ability 1n the digital aøe by 1mplementing these strategies.
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)
Industry 5.0 represents the next cvoluuonary stage 1n 1ndus-
trial development. In the clothing 1ndustry, CPS plays a
pivotal role by integrating physical processes with digital
systems, enabling real-nme data exchange and decision-
making (Alguliyev et al. 2018). It facilitates more efficient
production processes, enhances product customization, and
reduces waste. For 1nstance, smart machines equipped with
Sensors can monitor the quality of fabrics in real-time, adJust
manufacturing parameters accordingly, and communicate
directly with human workers or other systems to optimize
the production flow (S. Sahoo and Lo 2022). In order to

1ncreased by 1ntegration of CPS (Jamaludin and Rohani
2018).
Incorporating loT
In the clothing 1ndustry, 1ts 1ntegration with IOT has led to
transformative advances 1n both production and consumer
experience. Motion, gesture, and position sensors are com-
monly employed, with accelerometers and gyroscopes being
the most frequently used. In some applicauons, a barometer
1s utll1Zed to measure altitude (Yin and Sun 2025). Body
temperature can be measured using various sensors, such
as thermistors or Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTD)
(J.-W. Lee et al. 2018). Equipment used in the e-textiles
can have IOT sensors 1ntegrated to collect information on
machine performance, energy usagøe, and product quality.
Through analysis, 1t can be used to streamline workflows,
enhance resource cfficiency, and cut down on waste (Man-
glami et al. 2019).
AI and Machine Learning
Large datasets can be analyzed by AI and machine learning
algorithms to ñnd trends, Improve production schedules, and
Ễ Springer
forecast equipment faults (S. Arora and MaJjumdar 2022).
AI-driven systems can also Improve product personaliza-
tion through trend and preference analysis (Halepoto et al.
2022). Defects are detected, failure rates analyzed, and con-
trol setungs adJusted to optimiZe spinning by AI. Typically,
AI analyZes yarn`s programmable quality characterisucs. A
high-resolution camera captures Images of yarn flaws, which
are then analyzed by a preprogrammed system (Sikka ct al.
2024). Over 70% of reported defects larger than 2 m and
moving faster than 30 m per minute would be difficult for
a human 1nspector to detect and manage. It 1s claimed that
90% of defects in plain texiles can be detected using thresh-
olding (Horbovyy et al. 2023). Deep learning was used in
another study to automatically detect defects 1n woven cloth,
achieving classification accuracies of 78.1% for holes, 81.6%
for stains, 84.7% for selvcdge tails, and 74.6% for snarls (Das
etal.2021).
Textile Circularity
The circular ecconomy and sustainability are key compo-
nents of Industry 5.0 (Repp et al. 2021b). Manufacturers
Of texU]es can use sustainable materials, use less energy
and water, and start recycling and upcycling 1nitiatIves
(Awan and Sroufe 2022). Adopting sustainable practices
1mpTroves consumer loyalty and brand reputation while
also reducing the Impact on the environment (Kant Hvass
and Pedersen 2019). Intelligent production systems can
Materials Circular Economy (2025) 7:20
track a product's lifecycle, oplmiZe 1ts use, and ensure thc
materials are repurposed at the end of life, thus reducing
Wwaste and promoting sustainability (Andrews 2015). It not
only minim1Zes environmental impacts but also opens new
avenues for business models focused on apparel repalr,
upcycling, and leasing, aligning with the principles of a
circular cconomy. The 1ntegration of advanced digital sys-
tems with tradinonal human-driven processes promotes
1nnovation and creativity n sustainable fashion, marking
a transformative approach for the future of the clothing
1ndustry (Di Maio et al. 2017).
Automation
Automation and robotics can 1ncrease precision, expedite
repeUtive Jobs, and cnhance worker safety in clothing man-
ufacturing processes. Cobots, can 1ncrease flexibility and
productivity by collaborating with human opcrators (Fast-
Berglund cet al. 2016). Automated sewing technologices such
as robotic arms with AI-driven vision systems enable com-
plex stitching patterns with minimal human 1ntervenuon. In
Addition, AI-powered robots facilitate real-time quality con-
trol by detecting defects and 1nconsistencies, reducing waste
and I¡mproving product quality (Manjulatha et al. 2024).
Smart industries enable 1nterconnected robotic systems that
communicate and adapt to dynamic production demands,
ensuring mass customization and on-demand manufacturing.
These 1nnovations not only enhance productivity but also
contribute to sustainable practices by minimiZing material
Wwastage and optimiZing cnergy consumption.
Digital Twins
Digital twins are digital copies of real-world resources,
operatlons, or setups (Donmezer et al. 2023c). Predicuve
analysis, optimiZation, and simulation are made possible
1n the clothing manufacturing process by 1mplementing
digital twins. Manufacturers can use this technology to test
new concepts, maximiZe output, and shorten time to mar-
ket (Donmezer et al. 2023 d). Digital representations allow
real-time monitoring, predicUve maintenance, and enhanced
decision-making through data-driven insights. By simulatung
production scenarios, digital twins help manufacturers to
optimize fabric uũliZation, reduce waste, and 1mpTove Oper-
aũonal efficiency. Additionally, in fashion retail, 1t enable
brands to create hyper-personalized shopping experiences
by allowing consumers to visualizZe customi1zed clothing
designs before production. It reduces returns and OVerpro-
duction, contributing to a more sustainable industry (Alk-
hammash et al. 2022).

Challenges of Implementing Industry 5.0
The transiton from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 presents a
number of challenges for the clothing 1ndustry. It promises
sustainability, flex1bility, and human-machine collabora-
ton; neyvertheless, there are various challenges that can be
overcome before 1t can be applied to the clothing industry.
Integrating modern technologies like AI, JøT, and robotics
1nto clothing manufacturing processes while maintaining
the 1ndustry's traditional manpower and trained workforce 1s
one of the main challenges (Akter et al. 2024; Gabsi 2024;
Gangoda et al. 2023). Maintaining product quality and serv-
1ng niche markets requires striking a balance between auto-
mation and the preservation of artisanal skills (Eglash et al.
2020). Additionally, maintaining the sustainability of the
clothing 1ndustry continues to be a difficult task. To reducce
the 1ndustry`s environmental 1mpact, Industry 5.0 can place
a high priority on energy-efficient procedures, sustainable
clothing 1tems, and waste management techniques (Rame
et al. 2024). Additionally, 1t 1s technologically challenging
to achieve connectivity and 1nteroperability across various
Dieces of wear and systems 1n textile faciities. To secure
confidential information and 1ntellectual property, 1t neces-
sitates 1nVesting money on standardized communication
methods and strong cybersecurity defenses. In additon,
the overall potential of Industry 5.0 in the clothing 1industry
requires addressing the reskilling and upskilling demands
Of the workforce. Incorporating training programs and plac-
1ng a strong emphasis on lifelong learning would enable
employees to effecuvely participate 1n the digital revolution
Of the industry while maintaining 1ts legacy and workman-
ship. Main challenges for 1mplementing Industry 5.0 are
demonstrated in Figure 8.
Reskilling and Upskilling
Industry 4.0 was focused heavily on automation and data-
driven processes but Industry 5.0 emphasizes human-
machine collaboration that requires workers to develop new
competencies 1n advanced digital tools, AI, and robotics
while maintaining their traditional expertise. The rapid pacc
Of technological advancements creates a skills gap, making 1t
difficult for employees to keep up with emerging Innovations
(Leng et al. 2022). Industry 5.0, which incorporates modern
1nnovations like automation, AI, and data analytics 1nto the
clothing 1ndustry, heavily relies on reskilling and upskilling.
Organizations can 1nvest significantly in training 1niiatives,
promoting a culture of lifelong learning to ensure employ-
ees remain adaptable and competiuve. However, balancing
the cost of upskilling programs with operatuonal efficiency

Challenges of Industry 5.0
Fig.8 Challenges of 1mplementing Industry 5.0
poses a financial burden, especially for small and medium
enterprises. Without strategic planning and government or
1ndustry encourage, the lack of skilled professionals may
hinder the full realization of Industry 5.0`s potential, slowing
down industrial progress and economic growth.
Technological Advancements
The accelerated pace of technological advancements
such as AI-driven automation, robotics, and digital twins
requires 1ndustries to frequently update their systems. It
leads to high costs and operational disruptons. Additon-
ally, integrating new technologies with exisung industrial
setups can be complex as legacy systems can not be com-
patible with modern solutions. As Industry 5.0 technolo-
gies advance quickly, revisions and modifications to skill
requirements are 1nevitable. Workers find it difficult to
stay up to date with the latest developments as a result,
which calls for constant learning and adaptability. Without
DTODCT Strategic planning and policy support, industries can
struggle to keep up with these technological transiuons,
potentially leading to inefficiencies, Job displacement, and
a w1dened digital divide.
Limitations of Cost and Resources
Upskiling and reskilling employees can be costly, particu-
larly for startups or 1ndustries with limited funding. For
businesses, one of the biggest challenges 1s deciding how to
fund training programs while snll staying profitable. Tran-
sIiUoning to a more human-centric, sustainable, and resilient
1ndustrial model requires substantial investment in advanced
technologies, training programs, and infrastructure upgrades
(Shinge and Shrawankar 2023).
Ổề Springer
Resistance to Change
Some workers can be reluctant to pick up new skills because
they are worried about losing their Jobs, fecl uncasy using
technology, or are unsure of their capacity for adaptation. It
can stem from fear of Job displacement, uncertainty about
their ability to adapt, or a lack of confidence in digital tools.
Addituonally, organizations may face cultural and structural
challenges, where long-established workfiows and mindsets
hinder the acceptance of Industry 5.0 advancements. Effec-
tIve leadership, managerial support, and communication are
necessary to Overcome oppositon to change.
Lack of Learning Approache
Unhke tradiuonal education systems that primarily focus on
1mtial sk1]l acquisiuon, Industry 5.0 demands continuous
learning to keep pace with rapid technological advancements
and evolving Job roles. Industry 5.0 requires a continual
1mprovement and a hfelong learning approach. OrganiZa-
tons can adopt a new culture that empOWCTS WOTkers to grab
learning opportunities and take charge of their professional
growth. To successfully :mplement Industry 5.0, industries
and policymakers can cmphas1ze the 1ntcgration of continu-
OUS learning 1n1tiatives, enhancing a mindset of adaptability
and 1nnovation among the workforce.
Cultural Diversity
Industries hire workers with a variety of cultural origins
1n today”s globalized workforce. To achieve 1nclusion and
cefficacy, reskilling and upskilling programs can take cul-
tural variations 1nto account and provide training 1n mul-
tple languages. Cultural differences in learning styles,
Materials Circular Economy (2025) 7:20
communication, and workplace expectations can create chal-
lenges to effecuve training programs. Languaøe differences,
Tesistance to chanøe due to deeply ingrained work traditions,
and varying levels of technological exposure among employ-
ees from different cultural backgrounds can slow down the
adoption of new skills.
Job Displacements
The employment of sophisticated robotics in manufacturing
Drocesses, together with automation, are key components of
Industry 5.0. While automation enhances efficiency, produc-
UIvity, and precision 1n manufacturing, 1t also raises concerns
about workforce redundancy. The integration of advanced
robotics, AI, and CPS reduces the need for manual ]abor,
particularly in repeIUVve and routine tasks. It threatens Job
security for workers who lack the necessary skills to adapt to
new technological roles (Badet 202 1). Workers in the cloth-
1ng 1ndustry can find tt difficult to transiuon 1nto new posi-
tons requiring technological know-how, which could result
1n underemployment or unemployment.
Initial Investment
Upgrading cquipment, infrastructure, and software systems
necessitates a large 1n1tlal Investment 1n order to Implement
Industry 5.0 technologies. The cost of adoption can be pro-
hibiuve for many textile manufacturers, particularly Small
and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) which would limit
their competiuveness and create a challenge to cntry. The
1ntegration of advanced technologies necessitates substan-
tia] upfront costs for 1nfrastructure, cquipment, and training.
These technologies also require ongoing maintenance and
upgrades, adding to the financial burden. While the long-
term benefits of Industry 5.0, such as Improved productivity
and efficiency, can outweigh these costs, the initial 1nvest-
ment can be a challenge for brands with limited capital or
those operating in 1ndustries with tght profit margins (X.
Xu et al. 2021b). Consequently, businesses may hesitate to
adopt Industry 5.0 due to the financial uncertainty and risk
1nvolved 1n making such significant investments.
Data Security and Privacy Concerns
To streamline operaUons and enhance decision-making,
Industry 5.0 mostly depends on data collecting and analy-
sis. But also brings up 1ssues with privacy and data security.
To safeguard sensitive data from cyber threats and unau-
thorized access, 1ncluding consumer 1nformation and pro-
prietary designs, textlle industries necd to 1nvest 1n strong
Cybersecurity solunons. The volume and complexity of
Page23of37 20
sens1ve 1nformation being shared and processcd increase
significantly. It widespread the integration of smart systems
Talses concerns about unauthoriZed access, cyber-attacks,
and data breaches that can lead to the exposure of criucal
business and personal data (Tyaøi et al. 2023). Addition-
ally, maintaining privacy becomes even more challenging
as organizations rely on data from 1nterconnected devices
and human 1nteractons.
Supply Chain Complexity
Industry 5.0 1¡mplementation presents significant challenges
when addressing supply chain complexity. As Industry 5.0
emphas1Zes the 1ntegration of advanced technologies 1nto
the manufacturing process, 1t complicates the coordinaton
of multiple, 1nterconnected supply chain components (C.-H.
Hsu ct al. 2024a, b). Textile supply chains can become more
complex as a result of the 1mplementation of Industry 5.0
technology. Increased 1nterconnectedness and dependency
among manufacturers, distributors, and suppliers 1ncreases
the likelihood of 1interruptlons brought on by things like
supply shortages, traffic Jams, or geopolitical concerns.
Textile industries necd to allocate resources towards sup-
ply chain resilience measures 1n order to minimiZe r1sks and
ensure uninterrupted operations.
Regulatory Compliances
The clothing 1ndustry needs to abide by a number of laws
pertaiming to labor practices, environmental sustainability, and
product safety. Adopton of Industry 5.0 technology can bring
up new compliance 1ssues, such as making sure robotics and
AI are used ethically or making sure automated manufactur-
Ing processes adhere to cnvironmental regulations. The lack
Of standardiZed regulations for cmerging technologies makes
1t difficult for 1ndustries to ensure compliance across differ-
ent Jurisdictions (Rehman and Umar 2025). To prevent fines
and reputational 1ssues, clothing brands need to stay up to
date on regulatory developments and modify their operations
accordingly.
Sustainability Issues
Industry 5.0 raises questions regarding 1ts potental effects
on the environment even as 1t presents chances for waste
reduction and resource optimization. The complexity of
manaøing these technologies 1n harmony with existing sys-
tems can lead to 1nefficiencies, requiring significant tme and
Tesources to Overcome. The manufacturing of textiles uses
a lot of energy, water, and raw materials, which 1ncreases
Ẩễ Springer
pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, there
1s a need for new standards and regulations to ensure that
sustainability efforts align with global environmental goals,
which can be slow to develop. Textile ¡ndustries neced to
strike a balance between the advantages of automation and
sustainable practices 1n order to reduce their environmen-
tal Impact and satisfy consumer demand for green clothing
1tems.
Sustainability of Raw Materials
Like other industries, the clothing industry 1s focusing on
Industry 5.0, which aims to produce sustainable and cffi-
clent operations by combining sophisticated technologies
with sustainability principles. Compared to tradinonal
approaches, eco-friendly materials and processes can have
greater upfront prices (Gunay 2013; Karuppusamy et al.
2015). For businesses, particularly smaller ones or thosc
1n price-sensinve 1ndustries, 1t can be a major challenge.
Locating sustainable resources on a large scale might be
challenging. Industries find 1t difficult to 1mplement eco-
friendly clothing 1tems on a large scale because many are
sũll in the ecarly phases of research or have limited avail-
ability (OZlu et al. 2024). Compared to the conventional
counterparts, some sustainable materials could not provide
the same performance qualties. It can be problematic in
1ndustries where durability and performance are essential,
like textiles where comfort, stength, and lifespan are vital
components (Samanta et al. 2014).
It might be challenging to Increase the production of
eco-friendly materials and procedures to satisfy the needs
Of mass manufacturing. One of the biggest challenges in
developing sustainable production systems 1s ensuring that
these are scalable and efficient. Even while interest and
awareness for sustainable clothing 1tems are growing, some
buyers can still place a higher value on performance and cost
than environmental sustainability (Chavan 2011). It1s stl]
challenging to persuade consumers to purchase environmen-
tally sustainable clothing 1tems, particularly when cost more.
Using sustainableeco-friendly raw materials and procedures
becomes more difficult when strict environmental standards
can be followed. To maintain complhiance and maintain their
competitiveness, businesses need to manage an intricate
structure of rules and standards. A substantial 1nvestment in
research and development 1s necessary to create new envi-
ronmentally sustainable materials and procedures. Industries
and fashion brands 1n fast-paced industries like textiles can
fìnd it difficult to satusfy sustainability goals while kecping
up with rapid technical Improvements (Mu and Yang 2022).
Although sustainable materials have an influence on the
environment, recycling and end-of-life disposal procedures
also need to be taken 1nto account. Reducing waste genera-
tIon 1n textile and apparel manufacturing processes can be
Ổề Springer

achieved by 1mplementing advanced technologies 1including
automation, robots, and AI-driven process optimization (H.-
W. Hsu et al. 2024a, b; Senthilkannan Muthu Editor 2020).
These technologies aid In waste reduction and 1ncreased
resource efficiency by streamlining production parameters
and cutting down on material inefficiencies. Industry 5.0
makes 1t possible to embrace closed-loop systems and cir-
cular ecconomy practices. Blockchain technology and JoT-
enabled tracking systems can 1Improve supply chain trace-
ability and transparency and make it easier to recover and
recycle textile materials. Textile manufacturers can optimiZc
product designs and reduce material waste pTior to manufac-
turing by uũllizing digital design tools and virtual prototypce
technology.
Investments in technological progress
In the clothing Iindustry, switching from conventional
machinery to Industry 5.0 technologies presents a number
Of challenges. Industry 5.0 technology, such as IJoT sen-
sors, data analyucs, and automation systems, cannot be
compatible with tradinonal machinery because of a lack
Of connecUivity and digital capabilities. It can be costly and
time-consuming to retrofit or replace outdated equipment
to make 1t compliant. Employees used to operate conven-
tional machinery might not have the knowledge and expe-
rlence required to operate and maintain Industry 5.0-ena-
bled technology. It1s crucial to close the talent gap through
reskilling and upskilling 1niUatives, but doing so can cost
money and time. In Industry 5.0 contexts, real-time data
necessary for optlmiZation and decision-making cannot
be generated or transmitted by tradinonal machinery. It
might be difficult to integrate data from outdated machin-
ery with diøital platforms and analytics programs; creative
approaches to data collecung and 1ntegration are needed.
Conventional machinery might be built for particular Jobs
OT procedures, which would limit 1ts capacity to adJust and
change course 1n response to shifung production needs. The
focus of Industry 5.0 1s ag1lity and adaptability; thus, textile
manufacturers need to upgrade their current machinery or
make more adaptable equipment purchases to keep up with
changing demands. More regular maintenance and repairs
can be necessary for older machinery, which could result
1n more downtime and production delays. In an Industry
5.0 setting, ensuring the dependability and uptime of con-
ventonal machinery might necessitate further 1nvestung
on monitoring and predictive maintenance technologies.
For certain textile manufacturers, parucularly SMEs with
limited funding, upgrading or replacing outdated equip-
ment with Industry 5.0 technologies can be prohibiuvely
expensive. It 1s quite difficult to strike a balance between
the 1mtial costs of 1nvestment and the long-term advantages
Of 1ncreased productivity and competiuveness.

tems, which enables manufacturers to promptly detect flaws
or departures from quality standards (Barreto et al.2017). It
reduces the possibility of defective clothing 1tems cntering
the market and 1mproves quality control.
Customization
Industry 5.0 1s poised to revolutionize the clothing 1ndus-
try by enabling unprecedented levels of customization and
1ndividualization. Unlike Industry 4.0, which focuses on
automation and efficiency, Industry 5.0 emphasiZes thc
collaboration between humans and machines to deliver
more personalized, consumer-centric clothing items (Raha-
man and Khan 2024). This transition allows consumers to
actively engage in the design process, manufacturing appar-
els to their specific preferences 1n terms of style, fit, color,
and fabric choice. Industry 5.0 technologies enable clothing
1tems to be customized and personalized. Manufacturers can
Crcate Items that are spec1fically adapted to thce preferences
and demands of consumers due to digital design tools, 3D
printing, and digital printing. It 1ncreases consumer happi-
ness and enhances brand loyalty (Di Maio et al. 2017).
Circular Economy and Sustainability
As sustainability and circular ecconomy principles become
1ncreasingly vital n addressing the environmental 1mpacts
Of the fashion sector, Industry 5.0 providesoffers soluuons
that promote resource efficiency, reduce waste, and enhance
the durability of clothing 1tems. Through the use of AI and
JoT, manufacturers can optim1ze production processes, min-
1m1Z€e material waste, and create smart systems that track
apparel life cycles. It can allow for more efficient recycling
and upcycling (Rahaman and Khan 2024). AddiUonally,
human-centered approaches enhancer 1innovation by com-
bining fashion design and design experuse with advanced
technologies. In the clothing manufacturing 1ndustry, mod-
ern technologies help with sustainability goals (Kazancoglu
et al. 2023). Digitalizanon and data analytics, for 1nstance,

tory more cffectively (Barreto et al. 2017). The clothing
1ndustryˆs SCM 1s enhanced by Industry 5.0 technology.
Manufacturers can ensure transparency, cfficiency, and
regulatory compliance by tracking and tracing materials,
componernts, and finished clothing 1tems across the sup-
ply chain with the help of data analyucs, blockchain tech-
nology, and IJoT devices. Additionally, the 1ntegration of
blockchain for transparency and traceability can ensure
ethical sourcing and sustainability practices, mecting thc
growing demand for environmentally sustainable produc-
ton. As Industry 5.0 continues to evolve, 1ts 1mpact on sup-
ply chaïn optimization in the clothing 1ndustry can enhance
more flexible, sustainable, and consumer-centric operations
(Di Maio et al. 2017).
Upskilling Programs
As Industry 5.0 1ntegrates advanced technologies with
human creativity and 1ntuition, the workforce can require a
blend of tradiuonal sk1lls and new technological proficien-
cles. Adopting modern technologies calls for a workforcc
with the expertise to run and maintain 1ntricate systems.
In order to provide workers with the skills and knowledge
necessary to use these technologies efficiently, Industry 5.0
promotes 1nVestments 1n training and upskilling programs.
It 1ncreases 1Innovaon and competitiveness 1n the cloth-
ing Industry. Workers can need to adapt to operating and
collaborating with smart machines, 1nterpreting data from
advanced manufacturing systems, and uũlizing new digi-
tal tools for design, production, and quality control (Raha-
man et al. 2024). Ski]] development programs can focus on
1nterdisciplhnary expertise, combining technical know-how
with creativity to enhance Innovation in clothing design and
producton.
Globalization
ClothingTextile manufacturers can now collaborate globally
and reach markets more easily due to advanced technolo-
gies. Manufacturers and consumers are connected globally
through digital platforms, e-commerce, and online mar-
ketplaces, which broadens the market and creates growth
potential (Rahaman and Khan 2024). Addiuonally, tech-
nologies like virtual prototyping and 3D modeling allow
for cross-border collaboration and virtual product develop-
ment. The global perspectives of Industry 5.0 are displayed
1n Figure 10b. Globalization and commercialization are two
driving forces that shape 1ts future prospects. As the cloth-
1ng 1ndustry continues to expand globally, the integration
Of Industry 5.0 technologies promises to enhance product
Page27of37 20
customization, Improve supply chaïn transparency, and pro-
mote greater collaboratuon between humans and machines.
Adaptability
Industry 5.0 technologies improve the adaptability and
robustness of clothing manufacturingproduction processes.
Adaptability also extends to manufacturing, where produc-
tIon lines can adjJust quickly to market demands. I has a
pTospect of reducing waste and improving sustainability
(Barreto et al. 2017). By enabling AI and data analytics,
clothing brands can forecast trends, optimiZe 1nventory, and
reduce lead times, ensuring remain responsive to chang-
1ng consumer needs and environmental factors (Di Maio
et al. 2017). Manufacturers can miugate r1sks and sustain
competitiveness 1n dynamic business contexts by promptly
responding to external factors such as supply chain disrup-
tions, shifting market neceds, and other cvents by cnabling
real-time data analysis and decision-making.
Predictive Maintenance
As the clothing industry becomes more reliant on automa-
tion and smart machinery, predictive maintenance stands out
as a crucial aspect of enhancing operaonal efficiency and
minimizing downtime. Industry 5.0 makes predictive main-
tenance techniques possible for the clothing 1ndustry, which
min1miZes maintenance expenses and equipment downtime
(Rahaman et al. 2024). Production uptime and asset usapc
are maximized by proactive maintenance scheduling, prcdic-
tIve maintenance, and equipment health monitoring provided
by IoT sensors and machine learning algorithms. By using
sensors, AI algorithms, and machine learning, predictive
maintenance systems can monitor cquipment 1n real-time.
These technologies can detect anomalies and forecast poten-
Ual issues before.
Enabling consumer research
Enabling consumer research 1nvolves 1mplementing strat-
eg1es and tools that help businesses gather meaningful
1nsights into customer behavior, preferences, and expec-
tauons. The future prospects of Industry 5.0 in the cloth-
1ng 1ndustry le 1n 1ts potential to revolutioniZe consumer
experiences by enhancing deeper personalization, greater
sustainabilty, and enhanced 1nteractvity. Textile 1ndustries
can noW provide 1mproved consumer experiences via digital
platforms, e-commerce channels, and 1nteractive marketing
tools due to Industry 5.0 technologies (Kazancoglu et al.
2023). Virtual try-on experiences, 1mmersive product pres-
entations, and personalized sugøestions 1ncrease consumer
engagement and 1ncrease revenue. With AI and machine
learming, clothing brands can study consumer data to predict
Ẩễ Springer
preferences, style choices, and body measurements. It allows
them to provide personalized reccommendations and made-
to-order clothes. It can 1nclude using surveys, ÍOCUS ØrOUDS,
and digital analytics to collect and analyze data directly from
consumers (Rahaman and Khan 2024). Additonally, smart
textiles and wearable technology, like fabrics with sensors,
provide consumers with a more interactive and practical
shopping experience, 1mproving both style and comfort.
Global Collaborations
Industry 5.0 promotes global collaboration and connecuon
within the clothing 1ndustry, facilitating cross-border alli-
ances, 1nformation exchange, and market expansion. Indus-
try 5.0 represents the next phase 1n the evolution of ndustrial
processes. The synergy between humans and advanced tech-
nologies, such as AI, robotics, and automation can lead to
the creation of more personalized, sustainable, and efficient
manufacturing systems (Safavi Jahromi and GhaZinoory
2024). Global supply chain networks, virtual collaborauon
platforms, and digital communication technologies make
1t easler for stakeholders to collaborate, which increases
1nnovaon and competiUveness (Pinto et al. 2024). It can
enhance the cxchange of Innovative design 1deas, production
techniques, and best practices, leading to the development of
highly custom1zed, on-demand fashion that ensures diverse
consumer preferences.
Data-Driven Waste Management
Through data-driven systems, manufacturers can track waste
generation at every stage from fabric cutting to clothing
assembly, 1dentifying patterns and inefficiencies. Predictive
analytics can then be applied to forecast waste generation.
It can allow for more precise resource allocauon and waste
reduction strategies (Rahaman et al. 2024). Throughout thce
production process, textile waste can be continuously monti-
tored and analyzed due to Industry 5.0 technologies like JoT
sensors and data analyucs (Bajic et al., 2023). Manufacturers
can find opportunities for waste opUmiZation and reduction
by gathering 1nformation on waste generation, content, and
sources. As Industry 5.0 continues to evolve, It can empoWer
the clothing 1ndustry to not only minimiZe waste but also
recycle and repurpose materials more effecuvely, aligning
Wwith circular economy principles and driving the 1ndustry
toward greater sustainability and resource efficiency.
Closed-Loop Recycling
Industry 5.0 makes 1t easier to put closed-loop textile
Wwaste recycling systems 1n place. As 1t develops, closed-
loop recyching could play a key role ¡n making the fashion
1ndustry more sustainable. Using advanced technologies
Ổề Springer
Materials Circular Economy (2025) 7:20
like AI, automation, and smart materials, clothes can be
designed to be recyclable from the start (Kazancoglu et al.
2023). It allow apparels to be taken apart and their mate-
rials reused, cutting down on waste and saving natural
resources. The recovery of valuable recycling materi-
als 1s made possible by the efficiency and precision of
Wwaste separation enhanced by robotic sorting arms, AI,
and advanced sortng technologies. Future technologies
might 1nclude smart fabrics that can be easily separated
and reused, or AI systems that track the lifecycle of appar-
els, ensuring these are returned to the recycling loop at the
end of their use (Hu et al. 2014). This transition would not
only contribute to cnvironmental sustainability but also
provide new opportumties for 10novation, creating a more
resilient and eco-conscious 1ndustry.
Life Cycle Management
Life cycle management focuses on tracking, assessing, and
minimiZing the environmental 1mpact of apparels from raw
material sourcing to production, distribution, usaøe, and
end-of-life stages. Textile 1tems are tracked and traced
from production to end-of-life disposal, due to Industry
5.0 technologies (Rahaman et al. 2024). Transparent and
traceable supply chains are made possible by RFID taps,
QR codes, and blockchain technology, which also ensures
accountability and encourages appropriate recycling and
disposal methods. With the rise of Industry 5.0, advanced
technologies like AI, IoT, and big data can be the key in
1mproving lfe cycle management. AI can help design and
produce apparels with a smaller environmental 1mpact by
predicting the best materials and manufacturing methods
(Di Maio et al. 2017). IJoT can enable real-time tracking
Of clothing performance, providing 1nsights into durability
and wear. Additionally, blockchain technology can ensure
transparency and ethical sourcing, allowing brands to trace
Sources of textile raw materials, and maintain sustainabil-
1ty standards.
Resource Optimization
In the clothing 1ndustry, the future prospects of Industry
5.0 provide significant potential for resource optimization.
It encourages a more 1ntelligent, 1nterconnected, and eco-
conscious approach to production, where advanced tech-
nologies like AI, machine learning, and IJơT work along-
side human expertise to reduce waste, energy consumption,
and raw material use (Ghobakhloo et al. 2023). By opti-
m1zing the value generated by texũlle waste, Industry 5.0
makes resource opUmiZation possible. Textile manufactur-
ers can trade waste materials for recycling or reuse w1th
Materials Circular Economy (2025) 7:20
manufacturers and recyclers using digital platforms and
marketplaces. Additionally, Industry 5.0 promotes sustain-
able practices by facilitating the use of renewable materials,
recycling, and reducing carbon footprints, all while main-
taining high levels of customization and quality (Nahavandi
2019). The transition toward more personalized and efficient
clothing manufacturing can also lead to greater consumer
satisfaction, reduced environmental Impact, and ultumately,
a more sustainable clothing 1ndustry.
Conclusions
This review paper has explored the transformative shift
from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 In the clothing industry.
It analyses the Integration of advanced technologies such as
robotics, AI, and the JoT to promote sustainable and additive
manufacturing practices. The key theoretical Implication of
this review remains 1n evaluating the critical role of human-
centric approaches 1n advancing technological 1ntegrauon
within the textile and apparel industry. By emphasiZing
creativity, 1nclusivity, and collaboration, the study provides
a theoretical framework for incorporating human elements
1n the adoption of Industry 5.0 technologies. From a practi-
cal perspective, 1t provides valuable 1nsights 1nto how the
clothing sector can accept Industry 5.0 for increased sustain-
ability, producUvity, and innovation. The transition towards
a human-centric model presents a significant opportunity
for manufacturers and brands to address social and environ-
mental challenges while enhancing consumer cngagement
and product differentiation. t discusses the practical sigmifi-
cance of adopting resilient, flex1ble systems that encourage
continuous learning and development.
Despite ensuring valuable 1nsights, this review has sev-
eral boundaries. The transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry
5.0 In the context of sustainable and additive manufacturing
1n clothing 1s a relagvely new and evolving area. Ás a result,
the availability of comprehensive empirical data and long1-
tudinal case studies 1s Very limited which restricted deeper
quantitative analysis. Addiuonally, most of the existing lit-
erature are conceptual or theoretical in nature, with few real-
world Implementations currently documented, particularly in
developing countries where the adoption of advanced tech-
nologies 1s still n primary stages. The integration of human-
centric and ethical considerations 1s sũll under-researched
within the specific scope of additive manufacturing 1n the
clothing 1ndustry which clearly indicates a gap for future
empirical exploration.
Future rescarch should focus on the requirement for fur-
ther exploration of the specific challenges faced by SMEs
1n 1mplementing Industry 5.0 technologies and how these
challenges can be mitgated through policy or financial
1ncentives. Research should also explore the development
Page29of37 20
Of decentralized and 1ntelligent manufacturing models that
encourage mass personalization of clothing while adhering
to circular economy principles. Investugating the long-term
1mpact of Industry 5.0 on the global textile supply chain,
particularly 1n terms of sustainability and ethical labor prac-
tices can be significant for cnsuring the successful Imple-
mentation of the paradigm transition. Research into the
1ntegration of digital twins and AI-driven decision-making
tools can ensure more accurate production without causing
errors and could provide valuable 1nsights into ecnhancing
efficiency, reducing waste, and 1mproving resource manage-
ment to promote circular economy.
